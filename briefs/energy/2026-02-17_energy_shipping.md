## Top Risk Developments (max 5)

1) **US "Weeks-Long" Iran Campaign Plan Leaked** — Mechanism: Reuters reports (Feb 13/16) Pentagon planning for a "sustained campaign" targeting Iranian state/security infrastructure (not just nuclear) if talks fail → Asset impact: Sets a hard floor for Oil ~$67 despite diplomatic overtures; raises implied volatility as "Deal or War" binary hardens → **24–72h triggers:** Official White House confirmation/denial; movement of US assets matching the "sustained" profile. **[Confirmed]** (Reuters/Officials) **Continuity: Ongoing (Escalation Signal) (ref: 2026-02-16).** [web:20][web:32]

2) **Oil ($68.20) Rangebound on Binary Outcome** — Mechanism: Prices trapped between bearish "nuclear deal" hopes (Iran offer to cap stockpiles) and bullish "war plan" leaks; market paralyzed until one path is chosen → Asset impact: Brent pivots around $68; downside limited by "weeks-long campaign" risk, upside capped by ongoing talks → **24–72h triggers:** Breakdown of talks or official rejection of Iran's offer. **[Confirmed]** **Continuity: Ongoing (ref: 2026-02-16).** [web:27][web:32][file:13]

3) **Red Sea "Deceptive Pause" & Permanent Threat** — Mechanism: Despite lull reports, Yemen PLC leadership warns "temporary pauses" are tactical; structural risk to shipping remains "permanent" without kinetic resolution → Asset impact: Insurance premiums and rerouting costs baked into baseline; no return to Suez expected near-term → **24–72h triggers:** Resumption of attacks on US/EU naval assets. **[Confirmed]** **Continuity: Ongoing (ref: 2026-02-16).** [web:31][file:13]

4) **Hormuz Tanker Harassment (Feb 3 Incident)** — Mechanism: Confirmation of Iranian gunboats approaching US tanker (Feb 3) + MARAD "Stay Away" advisory validates "Shadow War" risk → Asset impact: Tanker freight rates maintain risk premium; physical disruption risk remains non-zero but below kinetic threshold → **24–72h triggers:** New boarding attempt or interception. **[Confirmed]** **Continuity: Ongoing (ref: 2026-02-16).** [web:29][file:13]

5) **Taiwan Strait: "Median Line" Erasure Normalized** — Mechanism: Post-Dec 2025 "Strait Thunder" drills, crossing the median line has become routine (90+ aircraft/day peaks); reducing warning time for actual escalation → Asset impact: Long-term semiconductor supply chain hedging (inventory building); minor shipping friction → **24–72h triggers:** Large-scale crossing event (>50 sorties). **[Confirmed]** **Continuity: Ongoing (ref: 2026-02-16).** [web:28][web:33]

## Mandatory chokepoints (change vs prior brief)

### Strait of Hormuz — **↔ (Elevated Risk) (ref: 2026-02-16)**
- Status: "Weeks-long" war planning leak raises tail risk; harassment (Feb 3) confirms tactical friction. [web:20][web:29]
- Watch for: Pre-emptive Iranian naval maneuvering if talks collapse. [file:13]

### Red Sea / Suez — **↔ (Blocked) (ref: 2026-02-16)**
- Status: "Permanent threat" narrative dominates; rerouting is the fixed baseline. [web:31]
- Watch for: New attack cycle breaking the "deceptive pause". [file:13]

### Taiwan Strait / South China Sea — **↔ (Status Quo) (ref: 2026-02-16)**
- Status: Median line erasure normalized; commercial flows continue despite military density. [web:28]
- Watch for: "Quarantine" drills or coast guard inspections. [file:13]
