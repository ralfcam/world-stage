## Top Risk Developments (max 5)

1) **Iran "Nuclear Deal" offer clashes with "War Planning" reports** — Mechanism: conflicting signals create pricing paralysis: Reuters exclusive (Feb 15) on "weeks-long" Pentagon campaign vs. Iran's Feb 14 offer to cap enriched uranium stockpiles (in exchange for relief) → Asset impact: Brent stuck in $67–68 range; volatility elevated as traders await definitive direction (White House rejection or acceptance); upside skew remains due to military mobilization reports → **24–72h triggers:** US official response to nuclear offer; new intel on carrier group positioning. **[Confirmed]** (Iran FM) / **[Reported]** (Reuters) **Continuity: New (Binary Signal) (ref: 2026-02-15).** [web:30][web:26][cite:19]

2) **Red Sea "Permanent Threat" Pricing (Munich Conf)** — Mechanism: Yemen PLC head Al-Alimi warns at Munich (Feb 14) that "temporary pauses" in attacks are deceptive; Houthi capabilities remain fully intact despite US strikes → Asset impact: Shipping rates floor solidified; insurance premiums sticky as operators price in long-term disruption rather than imminent resolution → **24–72h triggers:** New Houthi attack on US-flagged vessel; expansion of target list. **[Confirmed]** **Continuity: Ongoing (ref: 2026-02-15).** [web:31][web:34][file:13]

3) **Hormuz "Stay Away" Advisory Pricing** — Mechanism: MARAD advisory (Feb 9) explicitly warning US-flagged vessels to avoid Iranian waters due to "boarding attempts" remains the prevailing guidance → Asset impact: Tanker uncertainty premium persists; potential for shadow fleet disruptions if enforcement tightens → **24–72h triggers:** Confirmed boarding attempt; Iranian naval drill (announced Jan 30). **[Confirmed]** **Continuity: Ongoing (ref: 2026-02-15).** [web:21][web:27][file:13]

4) **Oil ($67.80) Resilience** — Mechanism: Market refusal to sell off on "nuclear openness" news suggests the geopolitical floor is firm; traders prioritize tangible military risk over diplomatic signaling → Asset impact: Support at $67 holding; upside breakout potential on any negative US response to Iran offer → **24–72h triggers:** Break below $66 (technicals); OPEC+ commentary on balance. **[Confirmed]** **Continuity: Ongoing (ref: 2026-02-15).** [web:32][web:23][file:13]

5) **South China Sea Friction (Sabina Shoal)** — Mechanism: Continuing low-level friction (collisions/blame-trading) without escalation to kinetic conflict → Asset impact: Localized shipping friction; minimal macro contagion currently priced → **24–72h triggers:** High-profile collision or injury. **[Reported]** **Continuity: Ongoing (ref: 2026-02-15).** [web:36][file:13]
