# Energy + Shipping Risk Premium (CET) — 2026-02-23

## 1. Top-5 Market Drivers (Energy/Shipping)
### [Confirmed] US 48h Ultimatum to Iran (Geneva Talks)
- **Mechanism**: Geopolitical risk premium + potential kinetic escalation. Washington issued a 48-hour deadline (Sun Feb 22) for Tehran to submit a "concrete nuclear proposal" ahead of potential Friday talks in Geneva. Trump warned this is the "final window" before considering military options.
- **Asset Impact**: Brent >$71.76; Call skew bid in oil options; potential safe-haven USD bid.
- **Triggers (24-72h)**: Submission of Iranian proposal (Tue) or expiration of deadline leading to immediate US/Israel signaling (e.g., carrier group moves).
- **Continuity**: New (ref: 2026-02-23)

### [Confirmed] Russia Massive Energy Grid Strikes (Feb 21-22)
- **Mechanism**: Supply destruction + grid stability shock. Large-scale drone/missile barrage targeted generation and transmission infrastructure in Kyiv, Odesa, and Kharkiv.
- **Asset Impact**: EU Gas (TTF) ~€31.52/MWh (volatility support); Ukraine power import surge potentially tightening regional balances.
- **Triggers (24-72h)**: Damage assessment confirmation; emergency ENTSO-E synchronization measures.
- **Continuity**: Ongoing (ref: 2026-02-21)

### [Reported] Iran Student Protests Re-ignite (Feb 21-22)
- **Mechanism**: Regime stability shock. Protests reported at universities in Tehran, Mashhad, and Isfahan calling for leadership change, coinciding with US ultimatum pressure.
- **Asset Impact**: Long-tail risk to Iranian oil output (1.5mb/d exports) if strikes spread to industrial sectors.
- **Triggers (24-72h)**: Expansion to street protests or crackdown escalating to lethal force.
- **Continuity**: New (ref: 2026-02-23)

### [Confirmed] Gemini Alliance (Maersk) Red Sea Return Attempt
- **Mechanism**: Supply chain normalization test. Maersk/Hapag-Lloyd (Gemini) ME11 service scheduled to resume Suez transits "mid-February," testing the security environment.
- **Asset Impact**: Freight rates (downside risk if successful); Insurance war risk premiums.
- **Triggers (24-72h)**: Confirmation of first successful safe passage or any Houthi targeting of Gemini vessels.
- **Continuity**: Ongoing (ref: 2026-02-02)

## 2. Chokepoint Status
| Theater | Status | Trend | Details |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Strait of Hormuz** | **Attention** | **↑** | US 48h ultimatum + potential Israel joint ops threat raises blockade/mining risk profile significantly. (ref: 2026-02-23) |
| **Red Sea / Suez** | **Attention** | **↓** | Gemini Alliance resumption attempt (ME11) signals potential de-escalation test, though threat remains. (ref: 2026-02-22) |
| **Taiwan Strait** | **Monitoring** | **↔** | Gray-zone activity stable; China critical mineral export controls (tungsten/antimony) causing supply chain friction. (ref: 2026-02-23) |

## 3. Watchlist
- **China Critical Minerals**: "Bureaucratic delays" on export licenses for Tungsten/Antimony/Silver acting as soft denial (Feb 2026).
