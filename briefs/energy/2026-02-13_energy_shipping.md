# Energy + Shipping Risk Premium
**Date:** 2026-02-13  
**Status:** Rising risk premium in Strait of Hormuz; cautious repricing in oil/freight

---

## Executive Summary

Energy markets face elevated but contained risk premiums as geopolitical friction intensifies in key chokepoints. Brent crude trades ~$67–69/bbl (5-week high range) with modest upward pressure from Hormuz transit tensions and OPEC+ production freeze extending through Q1 2026. EU gas remains subdued (~€32–33/MWh) on warmer weather forecasts offsetting earlier cold-snap concerns. Red Sea/Suez shipping disruption persists despite Houthi attack pause (100+ days), with carriers maintaining Cape of Good Hope diversions due to renewed threat signals. Taiwan Strait tensions involve military encirclement drills but no direct shipping interdictions; insurance repricing remains confined to specific routes.

## Top Risk Developments (Max 5)

### 1. **Strait of Hormuz: Iranian Interception Attempts & Transit Speed-Up** [Confirmed]
**Mechanism → Asset Impact:**  
IRGC boats attempted to board U.S.-flagged tanker *Stena Imperative* on Feb 2, 2026, 16 nm north of Oman coast; vessel increased speed and continued under U.S. Navy escort. Subsequent reports (Feb 5–12) show VLCCs transiting at 17 knots vs typical 13 knots, indicating heightened risk perception. U.S. Central Command issued fresh transit guidance Feb 9. Mechanism: Repeated interdiction attempts compress risk premium into freight rates and tanker insurance; sustained pattern could force temporary diversions (Suez alternative via Cape pipeline or longer Cape route). Asset channels: Brent crude (+$2–4/bbl risk premium if sustained), tanker day rates (modest uptick), EM oil importers' FX (if supply tightens).

**24–72h Triggers:**  
- Confirmed boarding/seizure of commercial vessel  
- U.S./Iran military engagement in Strait  
- Official shipping advisory from major flag states/insurers recommending avoidance  

**Invalidate Conditions:**  
U.S.–Iran de-escalation talks yield interim arrangements; IRGC patrol frequency declines; tanker speeds normalize.

### 2. **Red Sea / Suez: Shipping Remains 60% Below Pre-Crisis Despite Attack Pause** [Confirmed]
**Mechanism → Asset Impact:**  
Houthi attacks ceased 100+ days ago (last incident Sep 29, 2025); Houthis declared end to blockade Nov 2025. Yet Suez Canal transits remain ~60% below 2023 baseline as of early Feb 2026, with carriers citing renewed threat videos (Jan 26) and U.S. carrier repositioning. Mechanism: Persistent rerouting via Cape of Good Hope adds 10–14 days transit, inflating freight costs and compressing inventory cycles. Insurance war-risk premiums remain elevated despite no kinetic activity. Asset channels: European container/energy import costs (modest inflation pass-through), bunker fuel demand (longer routes), Asia–Europe equity indices (supply-chain friction).

**24–72h Triggers:**  
- Confirmed Houthi attack resumption (kinetic incident)  
- Major carrier announces full Red Sea return OR permanent Cape routing  
- Insurance consortium issues formal all-clear OR extended war-risk surcharge  

**Invalidate Conditions:**  
Multilateral security framework established; carriers begin phased Suez return with stable insurance pricing.

### 3. **OPEC+ Production Freeze Extended Through Q1 2026; Brent at 5-Week High** [Confirmed]
**Mechanism → Asset Impact:**  
Eight OPEC+ countries (SA, RU, IQ, UAE, KW, KZ, DZ, OM) confirmed Nov 2025 decision to pause production increases for Jan–Mar 2026 due to "seasonal factors." Saudi Arabia holds at 10.1 mb/d, Russia at 9.6 mb/d. Brent crude rose to $70.61/bbl (27-week high, early Feb), currently ~$67–69/bbl. Mechanism: Supply restraint supports floor pricing amid modest demand; combined with Hormuz/Red Sea friction, underwrites risk premium. Asset channels: Brent crude (sustained $65–70 range vs $60–65 baseline), inflation-linked bonds (energy component), EM oil exporters' FX (stabilization).

**24–72h Triggers:**  
- OPEC+ surprise production increase announcement  
- Demand shock (China/EU recession data)  
- Major non-OPEC supply disruption (Libya, Venezuela, North Sea)  

**Invalidate Conditions:**  
OPEC+ signals April 2026 production resumption; demand outlook strengthens; inventory builds accelerate.

### 4. **Taiwan Strait: PLA Encirclement Drills, No Direct Shipping Interdiction** [Reported]
**Mechanism → Asset Impact:**  
PLA conducted large-scale drills Dec 29–30, 2025, simulating Taiwan blockade with warships/aircraft encircling island; follow-on patrols compressed buffer zones. Taiwan activated emergency response; Jan 2026 reports note PLA operating east of Taiwan (first in recent memory). Mechanism: Cumulative encroachment primes insurance repricing for Taiwan Strait transits (>50% global container volume); energy chokepoint risk (LNG imports to Taiwan, broader Asia–Europe routes). No confirmed interdictions or exclusion zones enforced as of Feb 13. Asset channels: Taiwan equities (tail-risk discount), regional shipping insurance (incremental premium), semiconductors/tech supply chains (contingency planning).

**24–72h Triggers:**  
- PLA enforcement of exclusion/inspection zones  
- Confirmed delay/diversion of commercial vessels  
- Major insurer announces Taiwan Strait surcharge OR coverage withdrawal  
- Taiwan energy reserves drop below 2-week threshold (LNG/coal)  

**Invalidate Conditions:**  
PLA patrol intensity normalizes; no enforcement actions; insurance pricing stabilizes.

### 5. **EU Natural Gas: Subdued Pricing Despite Cold-Snap Reversal** [Confirmed]
**Mechanism → Asset Impact:**  
TTF gas futures ~€32–33/MWh as of Feb 12, 2026, down from early-Feb spike (~€36/MWh) as meteorologists revised cold-snap forecasts to show warmer weather. Mechanism: Warmer outlook reduces heating demand; ample LNG supply (2026 imports forecast 145 mt, +25% YoY) keeps prices capped despite Russian pipeline phase-out. Asset channels: EU inflation (energy component muted), power utilities (margin stability), industrial gas consumers (cost relief). No immediate repricing trigger unless supply shock materializes.

**24–72h Triggers:**  
- Unexpected cold-snap extension beyond Feb forecasts  
- LNG supply disruption (U.S. Gulf Coast weather, Qatari outage, shipping delays)  
- Russian pipeline cutoff acceleration (pre-2027 ban)  

**Invalidate Conditions:**  
Spring weather transition; LNG cargoes arrive on schedule; storage levels remain adequate (>50% capacity).

## Mandatory Chokepoint Status

### **Strait of Hormuz**
**Current Status:** Elevated friction; no blockade  
**Key Developments:** IRGC interdiction attempts (Feb 2); tankers increasing transit speeds; U.S. Navy escort operations active; fresh U.S. guidance issued Feb 9.  
**Market Transmission:** Modest Brent risk premium (+$2–4/bbl if sustained); tanker insurance/day rates uptick; EM oil importer FX sensitivity.  
**Next Trigger:** Confirmed vessel seizure, U.S.–Iran engagement, or official shipping avoidance advisory.  
**Baseline Scenario:** Friction persists but transits continue; risk premium embedded in $67–70 Brent range.

### **Red Sea / Suez**
**Current Status:** De facto disruption despite attack pause  
**Key Developments:** 100+ days since last Houthi attack (Sep 29, 2025); Suez transits still 60% below pre-crisis; carriers cite renewed threat videos (Jan 26) and maintain Cape diversions; insurance war-risk premiums elevated.  
**Market Transmission:** Freight cost inflation (10–14 day rerouting); inventory cycle compression; bunker fuel demand shift.  
**Next Trigger:** Confirmed attack resumption OR major carrier announces permanent Suez return/abandonment.  
**Baseline Scenario:** Gradual normalization delayed into Q2/Q3 2026; Cape routing becomes semi-permanent for risk-averse operators.

### **Taiwan Strait / South China Sea**
**Current Status:** Military encirclement drills; no commercial interdictions  
**Key Developments:** PLA blockade simulation drills (Dec 29–30, 2025); buffer zone compression; PLA operating east of Taiwan (Jan 2026); no exclusion zones enforced; insurance monitoring but no widespread repricing.  
**Market Transmission:** Tail-risk discount in Taiwan equities; incremental insurance scrutiny for Taiwan Strait transits; semiconductor supply-chain contingency planning.  
**Next Trigger:** PLA enforcement of exclusion/inspection zones; confirmed vessel delays; major insurer announces surcharge.  
**Baseline Scenario:** Military posturing continues without direct commercial impact; insurance remains watchful but stable.

## Conclusion

Energy and shipping markets face a **rising but contained risk premium** driven by chokepoint friction rather than outright disruption. Brent crude's 5-week high reflects OPEC+ restraint and Strait of Hormuz tension, while Red Sea/Suez normalization stalls despite the absence of attacks. Taiwan Strait military activity remains in signaling mode without commercial enforcement. Key 24–72h triggers center on kinetic escalation (Hormuz boarding, Red Sea attack resumption, Taiwan exclusion zones) or major carrier/insurer policy shifts. Absent these, markets price persistent friction into freight/insurance without systemic dislocation.
