# Energy & Shipping Risk Premium — 2026-02-28 (CET)

## Top-5 Energy/Shipping Bullets

1. **[Confirmed] Brent risk premium still elevated on Iran tension but move remains within attention band (Continuity: ↔, ref: 2026-02-27)**  
   - Mechanism: Brent is holding in the low-70s with an estimated \$3–5/bbl Middle East risk premium embedded, as markets balance a structurally tighter supply picture with unresolved U.S.–Iran nuclear talks and the possibility of strikes, but without a discrete, confirmed supply outage.[web:22][web:25][web:31][file:13][file:14]  
   - Asset impact: Supports oil-linked FX and energy equities and keeps a floor under breakeven inflation, yet the daily change is below the "large move" threshold in INDICATORS, so global rates/FX remain driven more by macro and central-bank expectations than by a fresh oil shock.[web:22][web:25][web:31][file:13]  
   - 24–72h triggers: Attention upgrade if (a) Brent posts a >3–5% single-day move, (b) verified disruptions of ~1mb/d or more emerge via Hormuz or producer outages, or (c) OPEC+/major producers deliver an unscheduled guidance shift that tightens balances into existing chokepoint risks.[web:22][web:25][web:31][file:13][file:14]

2. **[Reported] Strait of Hormuz security premium persists as tail-risk, not base-case closure (Continuity: ↔, ref: 2026-02-27)**  
   - Mechanism: U.S. maritime guidance for Hormuz transits and Iranian rhetoric about possible closure keep miscalculation risk alive, but commercial traffic is still moving under escort and there is no confirmed, sustained interdiction of tankers beyond prior drill-related harassment.[web:24][web:25][web:33][file:13][file:14]  
   - Asset impact: Embeds an asymmetric upside skew in crude and regional shipping, consistent with analyst estimates of a \$7–12/bbl security premium in current Brent levels, yet curves and cross-asset pricing still treat a full closure as a tail scenario rather than the central case.[web:22][web:25][web:31][file:13]  
   - 24–72h triggers: Move to attention if (a) UKMTO/MARAD or equivalent agencies issue new, higher-level advisories specifically warning of boarding/seizure threats, (b) AIS or satellite data confirm a material slowdown in tanker flows, or (c) insurers hike war-risk premia for Hormuz transits beyond recent norms.[web:24][web:25][file:13][file:14]

3. **[Reported] Red Sea / Suez: mixed signals as Maersk partially retreats despite lower attack tempo (Continuity: ↔, ref: 2026-02-27)**  
   - Mechanism: Container carriers had begun cautiously re-opening Red Sea routes as Houthi attacks ebbed, but Maersk has now announced a temporary retreat from some Suez–Red Sea sailings and rerouting around the Cape of Good Hope due to "unforeseen constraints," signalling operational and security uncertainty even without a fresh large-scale attack wave.[web:19][web:20][web:29][web:32][file:13]  
   - Asset impact: Keeps war-risk insurance and freight rates for Asia–Europe lanes structurally above pre-crisis levels and slows the deflationary impulse that would otherwise come from full route normalization, but this remains a cost and delay story rather than an acute global energy supply shock.[web:19][web:20][web:29][web:32][file:13]  
   - 24–72h triggers: Attention if (a) major underwriters raise war-risk premia back toward peak ~1%-of-hull levels, (b) a renewed cluster of Houthi or copycat attacks forces a broad industry-wide retreat from the Red Sea, or (c) authorities issue new blanket advisories that shift the routing norm back decisively to the Cape.[web:20][web:23][web:26][web:29][web:32][file:13][file:14]

4. **[Confirmed] Ukraine grid narrative keeps EU gas risk premium in place but still regional (Continuity: ↔, ref: 2026-02-27)**  
   - Mechanism: Ongoing strikes on Ukraine’s power infrastructure sustain a narrative channel into European gas demand via potential re-exports or substitution, aligning with the active "Ukraine Grid Strikes" narrative and keeping a modest structural premium in TTF despite comfortable storage.[cite:18][cite:34][file:13]  
   - Asset impact: Supports European gas and selected utilities/energy names versus a full de-escalation counterfactual but does not yet meet INDICATORS attention thresholds for a global shock that would reprice G10 curves or broad credit.[cite:18][cite:34][file:13]  
   - 24–72h triggers: Attention if (a) credible reports of damage to cross-border gas or power infrastructure emerge, (b) EU regulators/TSOs flag material deviations in import or storage trajectories, or (c) ministers explicitly link security developments to contingency planning or rationing.[cite:18][cite:34][file:13]

5. **[Reported] No new OPEC+/producer guidance shock; balances still anchored on existing quotas (Continuity: ↔, ref: 2026-02-27)**  
   - Mechanism: With no unscheduled OPEC+ communiqués or surprise quota changes hitting headlines, current oil balances remain anchored in previously signalled April output discussions rather than a fresh policy shock, so the Iran/Hormuz premium is layered on top of, not compounded by, producer action.[web:22][web:25][web:31][file:13][file:14]  
   - Asset impact: Limits upside convexity in front-end crude and producer FX for now; options skew and energy credit remain sensitive to any surprise cuts or outages, but absent such signals the current move fits within normal geopolitical-noise ranges rather than a standalone driver.[web:22][web:25][web:31][file:13]  
   - 24–72h triggers: Attention if (a) OPEC+ delivers an unexpected cut/halt to planned hikes, (b) key producers signal a willingness to weaponize output in response to security developments, or (c) evidence emerges of unplanned outages at scale.[web:22][web:25][web:31][file:13][file:14]

## Chokepoints Dashboard (Continuity vs 2026-02-27)

- **Strait of Hormuz — Status: Tense but open (Continuity: ↔, ref: 2026-02-27)**  
  - State change: No new confirmed kinetic incidents, closures, or verified tanker seizures in the last 24h beyond ongoing naval posturing and prior drills; commercial traffic continues with heightened guidance but without observable flow disruption.[web:24][web:25][web:33][file:13][file:14]  
  - Market read-through: Sustains a non-trivial but stable security premium in crude that remains within INDICATORS’ background-risk band rather than triggering an attention-level repricing by itself.[web:22][web:25][web:31][file:13]

- **Red Sea / Suez — Status: Elevated but uneven normalization (Continuity: ↔, ref: 2026-02-27)**  
  - State change: The attack tempo remains lower than 2024–25 peaks and some services had resumed via the Red Sea, but Maersk’s decision to reroute selected sailings underscores that operational and insurance constraints are still binding, preventing a clean normalization.[web:19][web:20][web:29][web:32][file:13]  
  - Market read-through: Keeps a measurable freight and insurance premium embedded on Asia–Europe lanes, slowing any disinflation from shipping, yet does not currently constitute a new, acute chokepoint shock versus yesterday.[web:19][web:20][web:29][web:32][file:13]

- **Taiwan Strait / South China Sea — Status: Strategically tense but quiet on shipping metrics (Continuity: ↔, ref: 2026-02-27)**  
  - State change: Beyond January’s U.S. naval transit, there have been no new attention-level PLA or USN maneuvers, exclusion zones, or broad advisories in the last 24h that materially alter commercial shipping patterns, insurance pricing, or semiconductor logistics through the Strait.[web:30][web:33][file:13][file:14]  
  - Market read-through: Shipping and tech supply chains remain exposed to structural great-power risk but without a fresh 1–3 session disruption signal to reprice freight, equities, or FX beyond existing strategic premia.[web:30][web:33][file:13]
