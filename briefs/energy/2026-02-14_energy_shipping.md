# Energy + Shipping Risk Premium
**Date:** 2026-02-14  
**Status:** Risk premium steady-to-contained; Red Sea disruption persists, Hormuz friction remains episodic

---

## Top Risk Developments (max 5)

1) **Hormuz interdiction risk remains the key oil tail-risk** — Mechanism: IRGC small-boat harassment/attempted boarding raises perceived seizure risk and pushes war-risk premia into tanker insurance/freight; without an actual seizure, pricing stays as an embedded but *contained* risk premium → Asset impact: Brent support/optional upside, tanker day-rates/insurance sensitive; risk-off spillover into EM oil-importer FX if escalation becomes kinetic → **24–72h triggers:** confirmed boarding/seizure; US/Iran exchange of fire; UKMTO/flag-state advisory recommending avoidance; insurer consortium surcharge jump. **[Confirmed]** **Continuity: Ongoing (ref: 2026-02-13).** [web:20][web:32][cite:19][file:13]

2) **Red Sea/Suez normalization still delayed (Cape diversions persist)** — Mechanism: even absent fresh attacks, renewed threat signaling keeps carriers cautious, sustaining longer route times (Cape of Good Hope) and maintaining a background logistics risk premium → Asset impact: modest inflation impulse risk (longer transit time, higher fuel burn), but now partially offset by weak freight pricing; Europe import-sensitive sectors remain exposed to sudden security re-rating → **24–72h triggers:** confirmed kinetic incident; formal carrier decision to resume Red Sea at scale; official all-clear/security framework announcement; war-risk pricing reset by major insurers. **[Reported]** (threat signaling/return decisions), **Continuity: Ongoing (ref: 2026-02-13).** [web:21][cite:19][file:13]

3) **Container freight rates are falling despite chokepoint frictions (dampens pass-through)** — Mechanism: weak demand/excess capacity and blank sailings are pulling spot rates down, limiting near-term CPI pass-through from Red Sea rerouting unless security worsens sharply → Asset impact: reduces “shipping-driven inflation” concern near-term; marginally supportive for EU/UK disinflation narratives; lowers urgency of policy reaction to freight costs → **24–72h triggers:** sudden insurer surcharge spike; renewed attacks causing broad rerouting/port congestion; reversal in Drewry/WCI trend (several weekly increases) signaling tighter capacity. **[Confirmed]** **Continuity: New (ref: 2026-02-14).** [web:46][web:37][file:13]

4) **Oil is stabilizing in the high-$60s with Hormuz risk in the background** — Mechanism: absent a new supply shock, macro/demand and positioning dominate day-to-day, while Hormuz adds convexity (upside skew) rather than a linear premium → Asset impact: Brent remains range-bound but sensitive to escalation headlines; inflation expectations remain capped unless oil breaks higher; energy equities track spot with headline beta → **24–72h triggers:** escalation headline (seizure/strike); unexpected producer guidance shift; surprise inventory/demand shock. **[Confirmed]** **Continuity: Ongoing (ref: 2026-02-13).** [web:44][web:35][cite:18][file:13]

5) **EU gas remains subdued; shipping risk is not transmitting into LNG pricing yet** — Mechanism: with no confirmed LNG supply disruption, TTF stays driven by weather/storage and global LNG availability rather than shipping risk; Red Sea risk matters mainly via longer voyages/availability only if disruptions broaden → Asset impact: EU inflation tail-risk from gas is contained; power/industrial margins steady; watch for rerouting-related delays if security deteriorates → **24–72h triggers:** unexpected LNG outage; major weather forecast shift; shipping disruption explicitly delaying LNG arrivals. **[Confirmed]** **Continuity: Ongoing (ref: 2026-02-13).** [web:36][cite:19][file:13]

## Mandatory chokepoints (change vs prior brief)

### Strait of Hormuz — **↔ (ref: 2026-02-13)**
- Status: Elevated friction; no blockade and no confirmed seizure since the previously reported attempted boarding episode. [cite:19][web:20][web:32]
- Watch for: any confirmed seizure/engagement or official advisories/insurance repricing that would meet INDICATORS “attention” criteria. [file:13]

### Red Sea / Suez — **↔ (ref: 2026-02-13)**
- Status: De facto disruption persists via continued Cape diversions; near-term direction hinges on whether threats translate into kinetic incidents or credible carrier return. [cite:19][web:21]
- Watch for: confirmed attack resumption or a broad carrier/insurer posture shift (all-clear or surcharge reset). [file:13]

### Taiwan Strait / South China Sea — **↔ (ref: 2026-02-13)**
- Status: Military signaling risk remains, but no confirmed commercial interdictions/exclusion enforcement in the material cited previously; treat as tail-risk unless a commercial/insurance signal emerges. [cite:19][file:13]
- Watch for: official advisories, confirmed vessel delays/diversions, or insurer war-risk pricing actions focused on Taiwan Strait/SCS transits. [file:13]
