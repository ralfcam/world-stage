# Energy + Shipping Risk Premium (CET) — 2026-02-24

## 1. Top-5 Market Drivers (Energy/Shipping)
### [Confirmed] US Nuclear Ultimatum to Iran Expires Today (Feb 24)
- **Mechanism**: Geopolitical risk premium + immediate escalation risk. US 48h deadline (set Sun Feb 22) for Tehran to submit a "concrete nuclear proposal" expires today. Failure to submit risks cancellation of Thu Feb 26 Geneva talks and US military action (carrier groups positioned).
- **Asset Impact**: Brent ~$71.73 (+5% weekly, 6-month high); WTI ~$66.72; Volatility bid in energy options.
- **Triggers (24-72h)**: Confirmation of proposal submission (Geneva talks proceed) OR "Talks Off" headline (immediate Hormuz risk spike).
- **Continuity**: Escalating (ref: 2026-02-23)

### [Confirmed] Gemini Alliance Red Sea Transit "Live Test"
- **Mechanism**: Supply chain normalization vs. kinetic denial. Maersk/Hapag-Lloyd (Gemini) vessels *Albert Maersk* (Westbound) and *Astrid Maersk* (Eastbound) entered service ~Feb 3-4, testing the "mid-February" Red Sea return with naval escorts.
- **Asset Impact**: Freight rates (downside if successful); Insurance premiums (war risk stable but fragile).
- **Triggers (24-72h)**: Visual confirmation of safe Suez/Bab el-Mandeb transit or reported Houthi targeting of Gemini vessels.
- **Continuity**: Ongoing (ref: 2026-02-23)

### [Confirmed] Russia/Ukraine Grid War Follow-on
- **Mechanism**: Supply destruction + EU demand shock. Following massive Feb 21-22 strikes on Ukrainian generation/transmission, Kiev is drawing emergency power imports, tightening regional balances.
- **Asset Impact**: EU Gas (TTF) ~€31.52/MWh (supported); Carbon credits (EUA) on coal firing support.
- **Triggers (24-72h)**: New strike wave targeting gas storage or transit nodes; ENTSO-E capacity limits.
- **Continuity**: Ongoing (ref: 2026-02-21)

### [Reported] Iran Student Protests (University Campuses)
- **Mechanism**: Regime stability shock. Protests reportedly continuing at major universities (Tehran, Isfahan) coinciding with US ultimatum.
- **Asset Impact**: Minimal immediate oil impact; tail-risk of strikes spreading to oil sector (Khuzestan).
- **Triggers (24-72h)**: Expansion to general strikes or street violence.
- **Continuity**: Ongoing (ref: 2026-02-23)

## 2. Chokepoint Status
| Theater | Status | Trend | Details |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Strait of Hormuz** | **Critical** | **↑** | Ultimatum expiry (Feb 24) + US carrier positioning creates highest kinetic risk window in months. (ref: 2026-02-24) |
| **Red Sea / Suez** | **Attention** | **↔** | Gemini transit test underway; Houthi intent to target remains high despite naval escorts. (ref: 2026-02-24) |
| **Taiwan Strait** | **Monitoring** | **↔** | Gray-zone activity stable; tech export controls (Tungsten/Antimony) remain primary friction. (ref: 2026-02-23) |

## 3. Watchlist
- **EU Gas Storage**: Withdrawal rates vs. emergency flows to Ukraine.
- **US Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR)**: Potential release signals if Brent breaches $75 on Iran breakdown.
