# Energy + Shipping Risk Premium (CET) — 2026-02-22

## 1. Top-5 Market Drivers (Energy/Shipping)
### [Confirmed] Trump Iran Ultimatum (15-day deadline)
- **Mechanism**: Geopolitical risk premium + potential sanctions enforcement/strikes. Trump set 15-day deadline (~Feb 19) for nuclear deal; threatened "really bad things" on non-compliance.
- **Asset Impact**: Brent >$71 (+5% week); Volatility skew bidding up OTM calls.
- **Triggers (24-72h)**: Official Iranian rejection, further IRGC drills, or US naval posturing.
- **Continuity**: New (ref: 2026-02-19)

### [Reported] Russia Massive Energy Grid Strikes (Feb 21)
- **Mechanism**: Supply destruction + grid stability shock. "Hundreds" of drones/missiles targeted generation/transmission infrastructure (Kyiv, Odesa, Kharkiv).
- **Asset Impact**: EU Gas futures (TTF) volatility; potential surge in Ukraine power import demand.
- **Triggers (24-72h)**: Damage assessment confirmation; emergency EU power export flows.
- **Continuity**: New (ref: 2026-02-21)

### [Confirmed] Gemini Alliance (Maersk/Hapag) Red Sea Return
- **Mechanism**: Supply chain normalization. Gemini Alliance (ME11 service) resuming Suez transits mid-Feb 2026, testing security environment despite Houthi risk.
- **Asset Impact**: Freight rates (downside risk to diversion premiums); Insurance rates (war risk testing).
- **Triggers (24-72h)**: First successful transit confirmation or kinetic targeting of Gemini vessels.
- **Continuity**: Reversal (ref: 2026-02-02)

| Theater | Status | Trend | Details |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |

| **Red Sea / Suez** | **Attention** | **↓** | Gemini Alliance attempts resumption (ME11). Major de-escalation test vs. ongoing Houthi threat. (ref: 2026-02-22) |
| **Taiwan Strait** | **Monitoring** | **↔** | Standard gray-zone activity (PLA OTB resupply capability). No acute kinetic spike this week. (ref: 2026-02-13) |

## 3. Watchlist
- **China Critical Minerals**: Export whitelists (Tungsten/Antimony/Silver) active; bureaucratic delays acting as "new denial" (Feb 2026).
