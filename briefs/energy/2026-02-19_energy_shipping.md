## Top Risk Developments (max 5)

1) **Geneva: Iran "3-5 Year Freeze" Offer Details** — Mechanism: NYT reports Tehran willing to halt enrichment for duration of Trump presidency (3-5 years) and dilute stockpile; conditional on sanctions relief/oil export access → Asset impact: Validates "De-escalation" trade; explicitly removes immediate "breakout" catalyst for Israeli/US strike → **24–72h triggers:** White House confirmation of specific "freeze" terms. **[Confirmed]** (NYT/Reuters) **Continuity: Ongoing (ref: 2026-02-18).**

2) **OPEC+ April Output Hike Momentum** — Mechanism: Multiple sources (Reuters/Bloomberg/Kpler) indicate alliance "leaning towards" resuming supply hikes in April; aims to reclaim market share as prices hover >$70 (or ~$67 spot) → Asset impact: Front-runs March 1 meeting; creates structural supply overhang capping any geopolitical rally → **24–72h triggers:** Russian/Saudi denials or pre-meeting leaks. **[Reported]** (Reuters/Kpler) **Continuity: Ongoing (ref: 2026-02-18).**

3) **Ukraine Grid: Odesa/Sumy Critical Damage** — Mechanism: DTEK confirms "incredibly serious" damage to Odesa power infrastructure following Feb 16-17 barrage; heating/power offline in 5 regions → Asset impact: Industrial demand destruction; potential surge in diesel import demand for backup generation → **24–72h triggers:** Emergency EU electricity import spikes. **[Confirmed]** (DTEK/Ukrenergo) **Continuity: Ongoing (ref: 2026-02-18).**

4) **US "Weeks-Long" War Plan (Floor)** — Mechanism: Pentagon leak of sustained air campaign plan remains the credible alternative ("BATNA") if Geneva fails; keeps floor under volatility → Asset impact: Prevents total risk premium washout despite diplomatic progress → **24–72h triggers:** Hardliner congressional pushback against "3-5 year" deal terms. **[Confirmed]** (Reuters) **Continuity: Ongoing (ref: 2026-02-18).**

5) **Red Sea: "Deceptive Pause"** — Mechanism: No new major commercial vessel strikes in 48h, but operators maintain full diversion; "status quo" is effective blockade → Asset impact: Freight rates locked; no relief in sight → **24–72h triggers:** Resumption of swarm attacks. **[Confirmed]** **Continuity: Ongoing (ref: 2026-02-18).**
