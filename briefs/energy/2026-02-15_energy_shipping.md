---

## Top Risk Developments (max 5)

1) **US military planning for "weeks-long" Iran campaign (Reuters Exclusive)** — Mechanism: Report of Pentagon preparing for sustained operations against Iranian state/security infrastructure (beyond nuclear sites) + deployment of additional carrier/troops → Asset impact: sharply challenges the "diplomatic de-escalation" narrative priced into Friday's close; likely gap-higher risk for Brent/WTI and Gold on Monday open; major insurance repricing if carrier group enters kinetic range → **24–72h triggers:** official confirmation/denial of plan; Iranian reaction/threat (e.g., Hormuz closure warning); mobilization of US assets in theater. **[Confirmed]** (US officials cited) **Continuity: New (Escalation) (ref: 2026-02-14).** [web:20][web:26][cite:19]

2) **Oil (Brent ~$67.75) faces asymmetric upside risk on "State-on-State" signal** — Mechanism: Market was pricing "easing tensions" (high-$60s), but intelligence signals a shift from "proxy harassment" to "direct US-Iran conflict" planning → Asset impact: short-covering rally likely; volatility curve steepening (demand for near-term upside calls); downside limited by strategic reserve bid urgency → **24–72h triggers:** break above $70/bbl (Brent); US Dept of Energy statement on SPR; OPEC+ commentary on "supply security". **[Confirmed]** **Continuity: Ongoing (ref: 2026-02-14).** [web:27][web:30][file:13]

3) **Hormuz risk shifts from "Harassment" to "Theater of War"** — Mechanism: Presence of additional US carrier group + "weeks-long" campaign plans elevates risk from "tanker seizure" to "naval engagement/interdiction" → Asset impact: Tanker war-risk premiums could jump pre-emptively; narrowing of insurance appetite for US/UK/IL flagged vessels; potential "avoidance" advisories from flag states → **24–72h triggers:** IRGC naval exercises; direct threat to close Strait; US Navy warning to merchant traffic. **[Reported]** **Continuity: Escalation (ref: 2026-02-14).** [web:26][web:20][file:13]

4) **South China Sea friction simmering (China-Philippines)** — Mechanism: Recent incidents (capsizing, blame-trading over Sabina Shoal) keep tension alive, though contained relative to Middle East → Asset impact: localized shipping/insurance friction; no broad macro contagion yet, but serves as a secondary "conflict liquidity drain" if US assets are split between theaters → **24–72h triggers:** confirmed kinetic clash (ramming/water cannon) with casualties; US State Dept condemnation. **[Reported]** **Continuity: Ongoing (ref: 2026-02-14).** [web:36][web:37][file:13]

5) **EU Gas (TTF ~€32) remains insulated from conflict noise for now** — Mechanism: Healthy storage and lack of direct LNG disruption keep prices range-bound; shipping risk transmission requires specific Hormuz threat to Qatar LNG flows → Asset impact: muted reaction expected unless Iran specifically threatens LNG transit; focus remains on weather/storage draw → **24–72h triggers:** explicit Iranian threat to LNG exports; non-conflict supply outage. **[Confirmed]** **Continuity: Ongoing (ref: 2026-02-14).** [web:42][web:39][file:13]

## Mandatory chokepoints (change vs prior brief)

### Strait of Hormuz — **↑ (Escalation Risk) (ref: 2026-02-14)**
- Status: Shifted from "harassment risk" to "war planning" theater following Reuters exclusive on US military preparations. [web:20][web:26]
- Watch for: IRGC mobilization, "Strait closure" rhetoric, or pre-emptive tanker interdictions. [file:13]

### Red Sea / Suez — **↔ (ref: 2026-02-14)**
- Status: Disruption effectively permanent (Cape diversions); new US-Iran escalation could reignite Houthi aggression, but baseline is already "blocked". [cite:18][web:21]
- Watch for: expansion of target list by Houthis in solidarity with Iran. [file:13]

### Taiwan Strait / South China Sea — **↔ (ref: 2026-02-14)**
- Status: Periodic friction (Sabina Shoal), but remains sub-critical compared to Hormuz; commercial flows largely unimpeded. [web:36][web:38]
- Watch for: increased US freedom-of-navigation ops (FONOPs) drawing sharp Chinese response. [file:13]
