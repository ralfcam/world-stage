# Energy & Shipping Risk Premium — 2026-02-12 (CET)

Scope: energy and shipping moves over the last 24h, using INDICATORS.md thresholds to focus on oil price risk premium, confirmed advisories, and chokepoint-related insurance and routing shifts.

## Confirmed (primary-source / widely corroborated)

- **Oil up on US–Iran tensions and Hormuz guidance** → **Mechanism:** Brent has moved to around 70 USD per barrel with a ~2% daily gain, and WTI to the mid-60s, as markets price a higher risk of disruption to Iranian barrels and broader Gulf flows following new U.S. guidance for ships transiting the Strait of Hormuz. This meets INDICATORS.md’s “large daily move + supply shock narrative” threshold for attention. → **Asset impact:** Higher flat price and an explicit geopolitical risk premium across crude curves; supports backwardation and underpins energy-sensitive inflation expectations and commodity-linked FX/equities. → **24–72h triggers:** Any confirmation that the U.S. will move from guidance to active interception of Iranian tankers; evidence of visible rerouting around Hormuz; or OPEC+/Gulf producer commentary that either offsets (via supply) or amplifies (via rhetoric) the risk premium.

- **MARAD advisory 2026-001 for Strait of Hormuz** → **Mechanism:** The U.S. Maritime Administration has issued a six‑month Maritime Security Advisory (2026‑001) directing U.S.-flagged vessels to stay “as far as possible” from Iranian waters when transiting the Strait of Hormuz and the Gulf of Oman, citing a February 3 harassment/boarding attempt. This is an explicit official advisory under INDICATORS.md’s shipping/chokepoint criteria. → **Asset impact:** Raises baseline war‑risk and legal/compliance costs for tankers and product carriers with U.S. links; encourages routing closer to Omani waters and greater use of naval escorts, supporting higher freight rates and a persistent risk premium in crude and product benchmarks tied to Gulf loadings. → **24–72h triggers:** Follow‑on guidance from UKMTO or other flag states; changes in quoted war‑risk premia for Hormuz transits; evidence that non‑U.S. operators shadow U.S. guidance (e.g., AIS patterns hugging Oman or avoiding Iranian territorial seas).

- **Red Sea / Bab el‑Mandeb war‑risk pricing still elevated** → **Mechanism:** Recent market commentary shows Red Sea additional war‑risk premia oscillating between ~0.2% of hull value in quiet periods and up to 0.7–1.0% after deadly attacks, with many liners and tanker operators still routing via the Cape of Good Hope despite intermittent lulls in Houthi strikes. While no major new incident has hit the tape in the last 24h, the corridor remains a “high‑risk” listed area with structurally higher insurance and security costs. → **Asset impact:** Sustained elevation in war‑risk premia and rerouting maintains higher effective freight costs for Europe–Asia and Middle East–Europe flows, modestly lifting delivered crude and product prices and supporting the embedded risk premium in European energy and some container and tanker equities. → **24–72h triggers:** Any fresh missile/drone attack or successful strike on a commercial vessel; changes in Joint War Committee listed‑area status; or a visible shift in routing patterns (e.g., renewed Cape diversions after a calm spell) that would push premia back toward the top of the 0.7–1.0% range.

## Reported (secondary / scenario-building)

- **Talk of potential interception of Iranian tankers and added US naval assets** → **Mechanism:** News and analyst reports highlight that Washington is *considering* intercepting tankers carrying Iranian crude and could deploy additional naval assets if nuclear talks with Tehran break down. These are not yet formal policy decisions but, combined with the Hormuz advisory, frame a scenario in which actual flows of Iranian crude through the Gulf could be curtailed. → **Asset impact:** Supports an upside skew in oil prices and tanker war‑risk premia by raising the perceived probability of a partial supply shock from Iranian exports and retaliatory harassment of shipping. For now this is a risk‑scenario, not a realized disruption; markets are paying for optionality rather than a full shutdown. → **24–72h triggers:** Any on‑record U.S. statement confirming interception rules of engagement; reports of attempted or successful interdictions; or Iranian counter‑threats explicitly targeting Hormuz traffic that are backed by naval movements, rather than rhetoric alone.  [Energy][Shipping][Defense][Sanctions]

- **Analyst estimates of the current Middle East risk premium in oil** → **Mechanism:** Several recent research pieces attribute roughly a mid‑single‑digit USD per barrel premium in Brent to Middle East tension and Hormuz risk, on top of underlying balances; they note that US maritime warnings and sanctions enforcement posture have added several dollars per barrel relative to a counterfactual calm Gulf. These are model‑based estimates rather than hard data. → **Asset impact:** Helps frame how much of today’s oil price level is at risk of mean‑reversion if diplomacy stabilizes Hormuz/Red Sea versus how much room remains for an upside spike if a kinetic event or export disruption occurs. For shipping, a higher oil risk premium also feeds into bunker costs, though the larger driver of freight remains route length and war‑risk insurance. → **24–72h triggers:** New IEA/EIA/OPEC commentary quantifying geopolitical premia; a de‑escalation signal (e.g., softening of U.S.–Iran rhetoric or rollback of guidance) that could bleed a few USD/bbl from prices; or, conversely, any confirmed hit to infrastructure or exports that would validate higher premium assumptions.

## Chokepoints status (last 24h lens)

- **Strait of Hormuz** — Under explicit MARAD advisory 2026‑001 for U.S.-flagged ships, instructing them to keep maximum distance from Iranian waters and documenting recent harassment. Traffic continues, but perceived legal and security risk is higher, and war‑risk/escort costs remain elevated. Market focus is on whether guidance escalates into actual interdictions or broader rerouting.

- **Red Sea / Bab el‑Mandeb / Suez** — No major new attack in the last 24h, but the corridor remains a designated high‑risk area with persistently higher additional war‑risk premia and a significant share of global liner and tanker traffic still preferring Cape routes. Insurance pricing is highly incident‑sensitive, with scope to spike again on any renewed Houthi strike or fatality.

- **Taiwan Strait / South China Sea** — No fresh kinetic incident or blockade‑type move reported in the last 24h; regional navies continue routine patrols and exercises, and shipping lanes remain open. For now, the risk premium is mainly embedded in long‑dated scenarios and defense/electronics supply‑chain pricing rather than immediate freight or bunker shocks.
