## Top Risk Developments (max 5)

1) **Geneva Nuclear Talks: "General Agreement" Framework** — Mechanism: Iranian/US officials report "general agreement" on framework terms; Iran to present new proposal in ~2 weeks (Reuters/AFP) → Asset impact: Brent drops to ~$67 as immediate "War Plan" risk premium unwinds; market pricing shifts from "imminent conflict" to "diplomatic delay" → **24–72h triggers:** Official text leakage or hardliner pushback in Tehran/DC. **[Confirmed]** (Reuters/AFP) **Continuity: Reversal (De-escalation) (ref: 2026-02-17).** [web:20][web:27][web:30]

2) **Ukraine Energy Grid Strikes (Feb 16-17)** — Mechanism: Large-scale Russian missile/drone volley (450+ drones/70+ missiles claimed) targets power infra in Sumy, Kyiv, Odesa; 28k+ consumers offline in Kharkiv → Asset impact: Localized power/industrial crunch; signals Russia maximizing coercive leverage coincident with Geneva talks → **24–72h triggers:** Confirmation of specific generation capacity loss (GW). **[Confirmed]** (Ukrenergo/DTEK) **Continuity: New (ref: 2026-02-17).** [web:21][web:23][web:31]

3) **OPEC+ April Output Hike Speculation** — Mechanism: Reports surface that "some nations" see scope to resume production hikes in April; decision pending March 1 meeting → Asset impact: Bearish supply tailwind compounding diplomatic de-escalation; caps Brent upside triggers → **24–72h triggers:** Saudi/Russian minister comments confirming/denying "April hike" scope. **[Reported]** (Saxo/VirginaBusiness) **Continuity: New (ref: 2026-02-17).** [web:20][web:33]

4) **US "Weeks-Long" Campaign Plan (Floor)** — Mechanism: Pentagon leak of "sustained campaign" plan remains the alternative if talks fail; sets hard floor for risk assets → Asset impact: Prevents full risk premium washout below $65; implied vol remains bid on "Deal or War" binary → **24–72h triggers:** White House clarification on "Plan B" timeline. **[Confirmed]** (Reuters) **Continuity: Ongoing (ref: 2026-02-17).** [web:20][web:33]

5) **Red Sea: "Permanent Threat" Baseline** — Mechanism: No kinetic de-escalation; shipping operators maintain "avoidance" regime despite lull in new major strikes today → Asset impact: Freight rates/insurance costs locked at elevated structural levels → **24–72h triggers:** Houthi retaliation for any US/UK defensive ops. **[Confirmed]** **Continuity: Ongoing (ref: 2026-02-17).** [web:31][file:13]

## Mandatory chokepoints (change vs prior brief)

### Strait of Hormuz — **↔ (Elevated Risk) (ref: 2026-02-17)**
- Status: "Weeks-long" war plan leak balances against Geneva "general agreement"; Feb 3 tanker harassment remains latest kinetic signal. [web:20][web:29]
- Watch for: IRGC naval maneuvering during "2-week" diplomatic window. [file:13]

### Red Sea / Suez — **↔ (Blocked) (ref: 2026-02-17)**
- Status: Strategic rerouting is the fixed baseline; no new major kinetic event in 24h. [web:31][web:32]
- Watch for: Breaches of "deceptive pause" via new drone swarms. [file:13]

### Taiwan Strait / South China Sea — **↔ (Status Quo) (ref: 2026-02-17)**
- Status: Routine "median line" erasure continues; commercial flows unaffected. [web:28]
- Watch for: Escalation in "quarantine" drill intensity. [file:13]
