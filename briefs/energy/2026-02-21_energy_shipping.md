# Energy + Shipping Risk Premium
**Date:** 2026-02-21
**Status:** War-risk premium escalates (US-Iran deadline + Russia grid strikes); Red Sea "naval-assisted" test transits keep freight risk binary.

---

## Top Risk Developments (max 5)

1) **US–Iran 15-day ultimatum escalates crude risk premium** — Mechanism: Trump sets explicit window for nuclear deal, raising probability of kinetic strikes or "maximum pressure" enforcement → Asset impact: Brent/WTI front-end bid; upside skew in call options; potential tanker insurance spikes if Iran signals Strait closure → **24–72h triggers:** Official WH statement hardening timeline; Iran naval drills or "warning shot"; any kinetic incident in Gulf. **[Confirmed]** (White House/State Dept) **Continuity: ↑ (Escalation) (ref: 2026-02-20)**

2) **Russia launches massive energy grid strike (Feb 21)** — Mechanism: 425+ missile/drone barrage hits generation/transmission infrastructure, forcing localized diesel backup demand and tightening European product balances → Asset impact: Support for European diesel cracks (ULSD); potential power price volatility in neighboring markets (Poland/Moldova) → **24–72h triggers:** Damage assessment confirming loss of major thermal plants; emergency EU electricity import tenders. **[Confirmed]** (State File/ABC) **Continuity: ↑ (New Major Strike) (ref: 2026-02-20)**

3) **Gemini Alliance "naval-assisted" Red Sea return (Test Phase)** — Mechanism: Maersk/Hapag-Lloyd initiating limited transits with naval escort; success would deflate freight/insurance inflation, while failure (attack) would cement "blocked" status → Asset impact: Binary outcome for container rates; downside risk to freight costs if successful, sharp reversal if convoy hit → **24–72h triggers:** Confirmation of safe passage of *Albert Maersk* or similar vessels; any Houthi attack on naval convoy. **[Reported]** (Maersk/Hapag advisories) **Continuity: ↔ (Testing Phase) (ref: 2026-02-20)**

4) **Gulf maritime advisory 2026-001 (Seizure Risk)** — Mechanism: MARAD/UKMTO warnings of Iranian boarding/seizure risk remain active, sustaining baseline war-risk premiums despite no new *immediate* incident → Asset impact: Floor under VLCC rates out of Persian Gulf; supports crude geopolitical premium → **24–72h triggers:** AIS-off incidents; new vessel harassment reports near Strait. **[Confirmed]** (MARAD) **Continuity: ↔ (Ongoing) (ref: 2026-02-20)**

5) **OPEC+ April output hike narrative (Supply Cap)** — Mechanism: Expectations of scheduled production increase limit the upside from geopolitical risk premium; market balances focused on "volumes over price" strategy → Asset impact: Damps bullish reaction to Iran news; potential selloff if geopolitical risk fades without disruption → **24–72h triggers:** Saudi/Russia official comments confirming/denying April plan. **[Reported]** (Market Sources) **Continuity: ↔ (Ongoing) (ref: 2026-02-20)**

## Mandatory chokepoints (change vs prior brief)

### Strait of Hormuz — **↑ (Deadline Risk) (ref: 2026-02-20)**
- Change vs prior: Risk premium rebuilding on Trump's 15-day ultimatum; probability of kinetic disruption non-zero.
- Watch for: IRGC naval drills, advisory updates, tanker harassment.

### Red Sea / Suez — **↔ (Testing Phase) (ref: 2026-02-20)**
- Change vs prior: "Naval-assisted" test transits in progress; not yet full commercial resumption. High binary risk.
- Watch for: Safe passage confirmation vs. attack on convoy.

### Taiwan Strait / South China Sea — **↔ (Status Quo) (ref: 2026-02-20)**
- Change vs prior: No new immediate shipping/energy catalyst.
- Watch for: Commercial advisories, drill tempo.
