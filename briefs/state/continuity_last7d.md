## Key Narrative Arcs
1. **Iran/Oil**: "Ultimatum" Watch. Trump's 15-day deadline (from Feb 19) keeps Oil ~$72. US naval buildup confirms coercion phase.
2. **Russia/Ukraine**: Infrastructure & Diplomacy. Feb 21 grid strikes paired with "pre-talks" rumors.
3. **Red Sea**: Gemini Return. Maersk ME11 service attempting Suez transit (mid-Feb) marks a major supply chain normalization test.
4. **US Markets**: Growth/Yield Divergence. S&P 500 (>6900) ignores 4.08% yields, focused on "No Landing".
5. **Japan**: Policy Drift. Jan CPI (2.0%) weakens case for immediate BoJ hike.
