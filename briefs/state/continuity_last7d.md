## Key Narrative Arcs
1. **Iran/Oil**: High Volatility. Shifted from "Diplomatic Hope" (Feb 18 Geneva Talks) → "War Risk/Ultimatum" (Feb 19 Trump '15 days'). Brent re-pricing risk premium ($67 → $71.50).
2. **Fed Policy**: "Hike" Risk re-emerged. Jan Minutes + Feb Data (Ind Prod) pushed 10Y yields >4.10%.
3. **Japan Policy**: "April Hike" consensus challenged by Jan CPI miss (2.0%).
4. **Red Sea**: Gemini Alliance resumption test is the key active variable for shipping rates.
