## Key Narrative Arcs
1. **US Trade Policy**: "SCOTUS Reversal". Supreme Court strikes down Trump's emergency tariffs (Feb 20), reversing the dominant protectionist narrative.
2. **Iran/Oil**: "48-Hour Ultimatum". US demands proposal by Feb 24 deadline; protests reignite. Oil caught between supply risk and demand concerns.
3. **Russia/Ukraine**: "Grid War Returns". Massive Feb 21-22 strikes (~350 projectiles) target Ukraine energy supply, dampening "pre-talks" optimism.
4. **Red Sea**: "Gemini Test". Maersk ME11 service attempts transit; success/failure will dictate shipping risk premium for Q2.
5. **US Markets**: "No Landing + Legal Checks". S&P 500 buoyed by growth data and judicial check on executive economic power.
