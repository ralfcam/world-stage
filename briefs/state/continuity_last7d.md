## Key Narrative Arcs
1. **Iran/Oil**: "Ultimatum" Phase. Trump's 15-day deadline (Feb 19) repriced Oil >$71. Market pricing in high kinetic risk.
2. **Russia/Ukraine**: Intensification. Feb 21 massive missile/drone strike on energy grid confirms renewed infrastructure campaign.
3. **US Markets**: Decoupled Bull. S&P 500 (>6900) ignoring yields (>4.08%) and Geopolitics, driven by growth data.
4. **Red Sea**: "Return" Test. Gemini Alliance (Maersk) resuming Suez transit mid-Feb is the critical supply chain signal.
5. **Japan**: Policy Pause? Jan CPI (2.0%) cools "April Hike" bets.
