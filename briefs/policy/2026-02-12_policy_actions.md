- **BIS settlement with Applied Materials over illegal semiconductor equipment exports to China** — What changed: The U.S. Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) announced a settlement under which Applied Materials Inc. and Applied Materials Korea Ltd. will pay a civil penalty of about $252 million and undertake compliance reforms for illegally exporting ion-implantation semiconductor manufacturing equipment to a Chinese Entity List customer without the required BIS licenses in 2021–2022.
  - Who/what affected: Applied Materials and its Korean affiliate (financially and via compliance obligations), the Chinese Entity List customer involved (as a signal of tighter enforcement), and by extension global semiconductor equipment exporters dealing with China and Entity List parties.
  - Market channel: Primarily **equities** (semiconductor equipment and broader tech), **ExportControls**/regulation risk premia on China-facing revenue, and **SupplyChains** through tighter enforcement around advanced manufacturing tools.
