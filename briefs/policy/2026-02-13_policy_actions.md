## Active Policy Actions (Primary-Sourced)

### 1. OFAC Iran Sanctions Expansion – Shadow Fleet Targeting

**What changed:** U.S. Treasury designated 2 individuals, 15 entities, and 14 vessels under EO 13846 for facilitating Iranian oil exports via shadow fleet operations.  
**Who/what affected:**  
- **Individuals:** Turkish national (Mehmet OZSUREN) and Indian national (Akash Anant SHINDE)  
- **Entities:** Ship management companies in Hong Kong (ALL WIN SHIPPING), Turkey (AMON KIMYA, DIAKO IC, STAREX DIS TICARET), UAE (BAKHT AL AZHAR, MANARAT ALKHALEEJ, MPHASIS MARINE), India (ELEVATE MARINE), China (QINGDAO OCEAN KIMO, SHANGHAI QIZHANG), Seychelles, Kazakhstan/Georgia, Liberia, Marshall Islands  
- **Vessels:** 14 tankers (crude oil, LPG, oil products) flagged in Panama, Aruba, Cameroon, Barbados, Palau, San Marino

**Market channels:**  
- **Energy:** Disrupts Iranian crude/LPG export routes; potential tightening of tanker availability for sanctioned oil flows  
- **Shipping:** Insurance/financing constraints on designated vessels; potential rerouting costs  
- **Credit:** Counterparty risk for banks/insurers servicing these networks

**Market channels:**  
- **Credit/Banking:** Transaction restrictions for designated parties  
- **Cross-border flows:** Potential ripple effects on correspondent banking

### 3. EU 20th Russia Sanctions Package (Proposed – Not Yet Adopted)

**What changed:** European Commission proposed 20th sanctions package targeting Russian shadow fleet and energy sector.  
**Key measures (if adopted):**  
- Full ban on maritime services (maintenance, insurance, port access) for Russian crude oil tankers  
- Designation of 43 additional shadow fleet vessels (total ~640)  
- Prohibition on maintenance/services for Russian LNG tankers and icebreakers  
- Expanded export restrictions on goods/services (rubber, tractors, cybersecurity)

**Who/what affected:**  
- Russian crude/LNG exporters (Rosneft, Gazpromneft flagged for potential transaction bans)  
- European ports/service providers  
- Third-country tanker operators (China, UAE-linked ships)

**Market channels:**  
- **Energy:** Further constraints on Russian oil export capacity; potential upward pressure on freight/insurance premiums  
- **Shipping:** Reduced tanker availability for Russian flows; heightened enforcement risk  
- **FX/Rates:** Risk-premium implications for EUR assets if package triggers retaliation or energy-market stress

**Status:** **PROPOSED** (Member State discussions began Feb 9; adoption expected Feb 23-24, 2026)  
**Primary source:** [European Commission Statement – Feb 6, 2026](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/statement_26_318)  
**Tags:** [Sanctions][ExportControls][Energy][Shipping]  
**Date:** Proposed February 6, 2026 (pending adoption)

## Watchpoints

1. **EU 20th package adoption timeline:** If adopted by Feb 24 (invasion anniversary), monitor immediate compliance deadlines and any carve-outs for legacy contracts.  
2. **Iran shadow-fleet adaptation:** Track vessel reflagging patterns (Cameroon, Barbados flags prominent) and insurance workarounds.  
3. **Third-country enforcement:** China/UAE entity listings signal tightening focus on circumvention hubs—potential for additional designations if networks re-route.

## Linear Issue Recommendations

None at this time. Current triggers (major_sanctions_action, chokepoint_disruption) functioned as expected. If EU package adoption produces low-signal noise (e.g., measures already priced or ineffective), create issue to refine EU sanctions trigger thresholds in `triggers.yml`.
