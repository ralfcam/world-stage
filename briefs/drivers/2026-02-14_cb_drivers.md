# Central Banks & Macro Driver Update (CET)
**Date:** 2026-02-14
**Ref:** `briefs/state/active_narratives.yml`

## Federal Reserve (Fed)
**Status:** Noise / confirms prior
- **Last 24h:** No official policy statements or speeches. The quiet period and lack of new data drivers leave the "Growth Scare" narrative dependent on incoming data (e.g., Retail Sales).
- **Continuity:** Ongoing (ref: 2026-02-13). Market remains focused on disinflation vs. recession risk balance.
- **Next Event:** FOMC Minutes (Feb 18, 2026 - *Est.*).

## European Central Bank (ECB)
**Status:** Noise / confirms prior
- **Last 24h:** **ECB Wage Tracker** (Feb 13) release indicates negotiated wage growth slowing to 3.0% in 2025 and 2.7% in 2026. This "normalisation" confirms the disinflationary trend required for the current policy path. A blog post on asset manager supervision (Feb 13) highlighted non-bank risks but offered no immediate policy signal.
- **Continuity:** Ongoing (ref: 2026-02-13). Wage data supports the "steady path" narrative.
- **Next Event:** Governing Council Meeting (March 5, 2026).

## Bank of Japan (BoJ)
**Status:** **Potential repricing catalyst**
- **Last 24h:** Board Member **Naoki Tamura** (Feb 13) signaled hawkish intent, stating the BoJ will implement policy in a "timely and appropriate manner" and sees a "good chance" of hitting the 2% inflation target by spring. He noted rate hikes' impact has been "extremely limited," potentially clearing the runway for a March or April move.
- **Continuity:** New (ref: 2026-02-13). Tamura's explicit mention of "spring" tightens the window for the next hike, escalating the `boj_hike_cycle` narrative.
- **Next Event:** Monetary Policy Meeting (March 18-19, 2026).

## Bank of England (BoE)
**Status:** Noise / confirms prior
- **Last 24h:** Reports emerged (Feb 13) that the BoE is seeking outside help for private markets stress data, reflecting ongoing focus on non-bank financial intermediation (NBFI) risks but signaling no immediate monetary policy shift.
- **Continuity:** Ongoing (ref: 2026-02-13). Focus remains on services inflation persistence.
- **Next Event:** Monetary Policy Summary (March 19, 2026).

## People's Bank of China (PBoC)
**Status:** Noise / confirms prior
- **Last 24h:** No major policy deviation. The central bank maintains a "moderately loose" stance with expectations of further RRR/rate cuts in 2026 to support liquidity, as signaled in recent weeks.
- **Continuity:** Ongoing (ref: 2026-02-13). Easing bias persists without acute new triggers.
- **Next Event:** Loan Prime Rate (LPR) Announcement (Feb 20, 2026).
