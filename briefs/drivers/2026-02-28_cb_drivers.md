Confirmed (primary source)

- ECB: 27 Feb decisions note on EUREP enhancement and routine governance items are operational/implementation details, not fresh stance; no new rate or guidance shift in last 24h beyond the 4 Feb meeting. Continuity: Ongoing (ref: 2026-02-26).

Bank‑by‑bank classification (using INDICATORS.md thresholds)

- Federal Reserve (Fed)
  - Last 24h communication: Routine releases including H.15 Selected Interest Rates and H.8 commercial bank balance sheets, plus research output; no new FOMC statement or leadership speech. These track market pricing but do not themselves reset reaction‑function guidance.
  - Next scheduled event: FOMC calendar as per official schedule for 2026 (see meeting calendars and information page).
  - Market‑impact classification: Noise / confirms prior — indicators file gives weight to explicit policy path guidance, emergency operations or large yield/curve shifts; routine data/statistical updates do not cross that threshold.
  - Continuity tag: Ongoing vs prior assessment that policy path is data‑dependent but not in a new regime (ref: 2026-02-26).

- European Central Bank (ECB)
  - Last 24h communication: 27 Feb Governing Council decisions covering EUREP enhancement, ECB audited accounts, and various opinions/reports; these are implementation and financial‑stability plumbing, not a new stance vs the 4 Feb monetary‑policy statement where rates were kept unchanged and guidance reiterated.
  - Next scheduled event: Next Governing Council monetary‑policy meeting and press conference as listed on the ECB calendar.
  - Market‑impact classification: Noise / confirms prior — while EUREP standing access can matter in stress, the announcement is framed as a backstop enhancement and does not signal an imminent change in euro‑liquidity conditions or policy path.
  - Continuity tag: Ongoing vs prior brief’s description of the ECB as on a data‑dependent, meeting‑by‑meeting path with inflation converging toward target (ref: 2026-02-26).

- Bank of England (BoE)
  - Last 24h communication: No new MPC minutes, policy summary, or Governor/senior‑official macro speech specifically dated in the last 24h; most recent key documents remain earlier Inflation Report/Monetary Policy Report and prior FPC/FPC‑related stability outputs.
  - Next scheduled event: Next MPC policy announcement date on the BoE calendar.
  - Market‑impact classification: Noise / confirms prior — absence of new guidance means gilt and GBP drivers remain macro‑data dependent rather than communication‑driven for this window.
  - Continuity tag: Ongoing vs prior characterization of the BoE as balancing inflation persistence against growth risks with no fresh shocks (ref: 2026-02-26).

- Bank of Japan (BoJ)
  - Last 24h communication: No new policy statement, Yield Curve Control (YCC) guidance shift, or special operations announcement within the last 24h; most recent visible signals remain prior meeting communications and conference remarks.
  - Next scheduled event: Next Monetary Policy Meeting date on the BoJ calendar.
  - Market‑impact classification: Noise / confirms prior — INDICATORS.md highlights JGB volatility and explicit BoJ operations as triggers; neither has a fresh official catalyst in this window.
  - Continuity tag: Ongoing vs prior narrative of gradual normalization risk but no confirmed regime break (ref: 2026-02-26).

- People’s Bank of China (PBoC)
  - Last 24h communication: No clearly dated last‑24h rate or RRR action, PBoC statement, or major liquidity‑operation communication identified; ongoing narrative still centered on targeted easing and support for credit/growth.
  - Next scheduled event: Next scheduled rate fixing / policy window as per PBoC’s published calendar (LPR/Mid‑term Lending Facility timing).
  - Market‑impact classification: Noise / confirms prior — with no new official signal in this 24h, CNH/CNY and China‑growth channels remain driven by data and earlier easing moves rather than fresh communication.
  - Continuity tag: Ongoing vs prior description of a supportive but incremental easing bias (ref: 2026-02-26).
