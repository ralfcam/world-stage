# Central Banks & Macro Driver Update — 2026-02-25 (CET)

## Federal Reserve (Fed)
- Official communications (last 24h): Speech by Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee at the National Association for Business Economics, reiterating that inflation around 3% is “not good enough” versus the 2% target and arguing against pre‑emptive rate cuts until there is clearer evidence inflation is heading back to target.[web:25][web:28]
- Next scheduled event (primary source): FOMC meeting calendar and upcoming communications are listed on the Fed’s official events page: https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm .[web:22]
- Classification vs INDICATORS: Potential repricing catalyst. The speech leans more hawkish on the near‑term rate‑cut path, directly affecting **Rates** and **FX** expectations, and can move the front end of the UST curve if markets had priced a faster easing path.[file:13]
- Continuity: Ongoing (ref: 2026-02-24). Aligns with an ongoing narrative of a cautious Fed reaction function that remains focused on returning inflation to 2%, reinforcing but slightly sharpening the existing macro story on restrictive policy and delayed cuts.

## European Central Bank (ECB)
- Official communications (last 24h): Routine publication of the Eurosystem consolidated financial statement as at 20 February 2026, with no change in monetary policy stance or new forward guidance.[web:26] No new policy speeches or decisions versus the early‑February Governing Council meeting that kept key rates unchanged and framed inflation as stabilising near 2%.[web:20][web:23]
- Next scheduled event (primary source): Next regular monetary policy meeting and press conference dates are on the ECB’s calendar: https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/calendars/mgcgc/html/index.en.html .[web:20]
- Classification vs INDICATORS: Noise / confirms prior. The balance‑sheet release is operational rather than directional and does not alter the existing **Rates** or **Credit** signals; market‑moving guidance remains anchored in the earlier February decision, which already signalled stable policy with inflation near target.[file:13]
- Continuity: Ongoing (ref: 2026-02-24). Confirms the prior brief’s narrative of a steady ECB holding rates while monitoring inflation around target and fragmentation risk, with no fresh catalyst in the last 24h.

## Bank of Japan (BoJ)
- Official communications (last 24h): No new monetary policy decision, statement, or Governor speech in the last 24 hours on the BoJ’s policy or calendar pages.[web:24]
- Next scheduled event (primary source): Upcoming Monetary Policy Meetings are listed on the BoJ’s official schedule: https://www.boj.or.jp/en/mopo/mpmsche_minu/index.htm .[web:24][web:21]
- Classification vs INDICATORS: Noise / confirms prior. With no fresh communication, there is no new information on **Rates** or **FX** volatility; existing market narratives around a gradual, highly cautious normalisation path remain in place.[file:13]
- Continuity: Ongoing (ref: 2026-02-24). The absence of new signals leaves the prior brief’s characterization of BoJ policy—watching for signs of impaired JGB market functioning or explicit normalization steps—unchanged.

## Bank of England (BoE)
- Official communications (last 24h): No new policy decision or major speech in the last 24 hours; the latest official stance remains the early‑February Monetary Policy Summary and Report, where the MPC voted 5–4 to keep Bank Rate at 3.75%, with a narrow minority favouring a 25 bp cut and guidance that further easing is likely but “a closer call.”[web:30][web:33]
- Next scheduled event (primary source): Future MPC meeting and publication dates are on the Bank of England’s schedule: https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/monetary-policy-summary-and-minutes .[web:30]
- Classification vs INDICATORS: Noise / confirms prior. The current configuration continues to signal a gradual easing bias for **Rates** and **FX** without a new catalyst today; the marginal dovish skew was already priced after the February meeting and report.[file:13]
- Continuity: Ongoing (ref: 2026-02-24). Confirms the narrative of a data‑dependent BoE edging toward cuts but not yet delivering, keeping GBP and gilt pricing anchored to incoming inflation and growth data rather than fresh policy shocks.

## People’s Bank of China (PBoC)
- Official communications (last 24h): No new PBoC policy rate move, reserve‑requirement announcement, or official statement with clear macro‑policy implications in the last 24 hours on core PBoC channels.[file:15]
- Next scheduled event (primary source): Key policy reference points remain the monthly Loan Prime Rate (LPR) setting and official announcements listed on the PBoC website: http://www.pbc.gov.cn/ .[file:15]
- Classification vs INDICATORS: Noise / confirms prior. With no fresh easing/tightening signal, there is no new trigger on **Rates**, **FX**, or **Growth** impulses beyond the existing narrative of targeted, gradual support and managed FX.[file:13]
- Continuity: Ongoing (ref: 2026-02-24). The lack of new action keeps the prior brief’s framing of PBoC policy—incremental, domestically focused support without an abrupt liquidity or FX shock—intact.
