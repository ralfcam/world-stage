# Daily Market-Mover Brief — 2026-02-12 (CET)
Meta: timezone=Europe/Zurich; lookback=24h

## 1) Top 5 market-moving developments
1. US data strength (jobs) reprices near-term Fed cuts; front-end yields jump and USD firms → Channels: Rates/FX → Why now: higher-for-longer narrative gets reinforced into the next inflation print → Watch (24–72h): US CPI; follow-through in 2Y/10Y and risk assets  [Rates][FX]
2. Global risk tone stays constructive with Asian equities at/near record levels despite higher US yields → Channels: Equities/FX → Why now: growth/risk appetite offsets rate headwind for now → Watch (24–72h): whether US yields keep rising; US inflation data as a catalyst for cross-asset rotation  [Equities][FX]
3. JPY continues to strengthen even as broad USD firms, keeping carry-unwind sensitivity elevated → Channels: FX/Volatility → Why now: positioning is crowded and catalysts (rates, politics, risk) can force fast deleveraging → Watch (24–72h): USD/JPY volatility; any BoJ signaling; broader risk-off confirmation  [FX][Volatility]
4. Gold catches a bid into macro-event risk as investors hedge tail outcomes (rates/inflation/geopolitics) → Channels: Volatility/FX → Why now: hedging demand rises when macro uncertainty is front-loaded into the calendar → Watch (24–72h): real-yield direction post-CPI; USD follow-through  [Volatility][FX]
5. Oil risk premium nudges higher on renewed US–Iran tensions narrative, keeping energy → inflation pass-through on the radar → Channels: Energy/Inflation → Why now: geopolitical headline risk can reprice crude quickly even without physical disruption → Watch (24–72h): official statements/sanctions chatter; any shipping/security incidents  [Energy][Inflation]

## 2) Confirmed vs Reported
### Confirmed (primary-source)
- US CPI release schedule (BLS) — timing risk for rates/FX positioning into Friday’s print [Inflation][Rates] ([BLS CPI release schedule](https://www.bls.gov/schedule/news_release/cpi.htm))
- US Treasury daily rate data availability (Treasury.gov) — reference point for verifying curve moves [Rates] ([Daily Treasury Yield Curve Rates](https://home.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates))

### Reported (secondary)
- Stronger-than-expected US labor data lifted the dollar and pushed Treasury yields higher; Asian equities climbed to a record high (Reuters) — implies more resistance for duration if data momentum persists [Rates][FX][Equities] ([Reuters global markets wrap](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/global-markets-wrapup-1-2026-02-12/))
- US Treasury yields rose after a strong January jobs report (CNBC) — underscores front-end sensitivity to labor/inflation surprises [Rates] ([CNBC: U.S. Treasury yields](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/11/us-treasury-yields-investors-await-delayed-january-jobs-report.html))
- Euro area yields modestly fell while peripheral spreads stayed contained; USD strengthened vs most peers while JPY outperformed (CaixaBank Research) — suggests no immediate fragmentation shock, but FX dispersion remains key (CaixaBank) [Rates][FX] ([CaixaBank daily report](https://www.caixabankresearch.com/en/publications/financial-markets-daily-report/12-february-2026))

## 3) Rates & FX scoreboard
- USD rates / Fed: Front-end led the selloff after the jobs surprise; March cut pricing faded sharply, while markets still look for multiple cuts later in 2026. Next catalyst is US CPI on Friday.
- EUR rates / ECB: Euro area yields drifted modestly lower with peripheral spreads broadly stable; ECB narrative remains dominated by global rates impulse rather than new local shocks.
- JPY / BoJ: JPY strength persists against a firmer USD backdrop, keeping an eye on carry/vol feedback loops and any BoJ communication risk.
- GBP / BoE: GBP largely trades as USD-beta with rates; no major BoE-specific catalyst flagged in the last 24h.
- CNY/CNH / PBoC + China: China CPI data points to softer price momentum than expected, keeping focus on growth-supportive policy bias and FX-fixing narrative.

## 4) Energy & shipping
- Oil/gas narrative: Oil risk premium remains headline-sensitive (US–Iran tension narrative) while broader balance expectations still anchor price action.
- Chokepoints (Hormuz, Red Sea/Suez, Taiwan Strait): No confirmed new kinetic incident in the last 24h in this brief; watch for advisories, rerouting, and insurance cost changes.
- Inflation implication: A sustained crude bid into CPI risk can keep near-term inflation fears sticky even if core disinflation continues.

## 5) Sanctions / export controls / policy actions
- No major new binding sanctions/export-control actions with clear immediate market channel were confirmed in the last 24h (watch US/EU policy lines tied to Iran/Russia/China) [Sanctions][ExportControls]
