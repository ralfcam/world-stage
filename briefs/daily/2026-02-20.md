## 2) Confirmed vs Reported
### Confirmed (primary-source)
- Trump "15 Days" Warning (White House/Press Pool): Explicit deadline set for Iranian nuclear deal before "bad things" happen. [Geopolitics]
- Japan CPI Data (Statistics Japan): Core inflation slows to 2.0% y/y. [Macro]
- US Industrial Production (Fed): Rose, signaling economic resilience. [Macro]

### Reported (secondary)
- "Weeks-long campaign" (Axios): Report that any US military operation against Iran would be extensive, not pinpoint. [Defense]
- Saudi Output Rumors (OPEC Sources): Continued chatter about supply flexibility if prices lag (now offset by war premium). [Energy]

## 3) Rates & FX scoreboard
- USD rates / Fed: Bear flattening. 10Y ~4.10%, 2Y ~3.47%. Strong data + Hawkish Minutes = Higher for longer.
- EUR rates / ECB: Bunds yielding to US pressure. ECB minutes (Feb) confirm "disinflation on track" but growth risks linger.
- JPY / BoJ: USDJPY steady ~153. Inflation miss (2.0%) challenges the hawk narrative; BoJ must defend April hike logic soon.
- GBP / BoE: Gilts following global selloff.
- CNY/CNH / PBoC: Stable. Focus on post-LNY liquidity management.

## 4) Energy & shipping
- Oil/gas narrative: Bullish reversal. Brent spiked to ~$71.55 on Trump war threat, erasing "Geneva talks" dip. War premium returns.
- Chokepoints (Hormuz, Red Sea): Hormuz risk elevated by 15-day ultimatum. Red Sea: Gemini testing transit.
- Inflation implication: Oil rebound + potential shipping friction = renewed goods inflation risk.

## 5) Sanctions / export controls / policy actions
- Trump "Board of Peace" (White House): Inaugural meeting used to deliver Iran ultimatum. [Geopolitics]

## 6) Watchlist tiles (Tier 1 then Tier 2)
### United States (Fed)
Signals (3):

- 10Y Yield: Break above 4.09%.

- VIX > 16.

### Iran (Geopolitics)
Signals (3):

- Market Reaction: Oil +2-3%.
- "Guiding Principles": Overshadowed by threat.
Key uncertainty (1):

Triggers (24–72h) (3):

## 8) Linear issue drafts (max 3)
### Issue draft
Title: Update triggers.yml for "Presidential Ultimatum" events
Labels: Geopolitics, Workflow, CoverageChange
Problem: Current `geopolitics` triggers focus on "Kinetic incident" or "Official guidance". Trump's "15 day" verbal threat repriced Oil ~3% but wasn't strictly a "kinetic" or "policy" event yet.
Evidence: Oil moved from $67 to $71.55 solely on the "15 days" remark.
Proposed fix (triggers.yml): Add `presidential_ultimatum` trigger to `conflict` or `domestic_politics` section.
