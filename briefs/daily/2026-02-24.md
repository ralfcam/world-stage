## 3) Rates & FX scoreboard
- **USD rates / Fed**: Rates 4.50%. "Wait and see" stance. Market doubts on 2026 cut depth.
- **EUR rates / ECB**: Rates 2.15%. Easing path continues amid weak growth.
- **JPY / BoJ**: 0.50%. Carry unwind risk remains if global vol spikes on Hormuz.
- **GBP / BoE**: 4.00-4.25% (Sources mixed). Inflation persistence remains key.
- **CNY/CNH / PBoC**: 3.00%. Stability focus; export controls weighing on sentiment.

## 4) Energy & shipping
- **Oil/gas narrative**: Brent $72.06 (+0.80%). Bid up on Iran/Hormuz risk, capped by weak demand.
- **Chokepoints**: **Hormuz**: Drills/Tension (High). **Red Sea**: Gemini ME11 transit attempt (Critical test). **Taiwan**: Status quo.
- **Inflation implication**: Shipping insurance/rates could spike if ME11 transit fails or Hormuz closes.

## 5) Sanctions / export controls / policy actions
- **US/Iran Nuclear Demand** (Diplomatic): Ultimatum for proposal → Market channel: Oil risk premium. [Sanctions]
- **Russia Energy Targeting** (Military): Grid strikes → Market channel: EU power/gas prices. [Energy]

## 8) Linear issue drafts (max 3)
### Issue draft
Title: Fix ambiguous 2026 Central Bank rate data sources
Labels: [Rates][SourceGap]
Problem: Search results show conflicting BoE rates (4.00% vs 4.25%) and stale Fed dates (2025/2024).
Evidence: investing.com tables diverge; lack of canonical 2026 calendar.
Proposed fix (file + exact change): Update watchlist.yml with specific official central bank schedule/data URLs for 2026.
