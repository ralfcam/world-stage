## 2) Confirmed vs Reported
### Confirmed (primary-source)
- **Russia Energy Strikes** (ISW/Official) — Large combined strike package verified overnight; continued infrastructure targeting. [Defense]
- **JGB Auction Results** (MOF Japan) — Strong demand for 5-year sector; yields lower, supporting JPY stability. [Rates]

### Reported (secondary)
- **US-Iran Geneva Talks** (Brokerages/Media) — Reports of renewed nuclear talks driving oil lower; no official joint statement found. [Energy]

## 3) Rates & FX scoreboard
- USD rates / Fed: Hawkish hold; markets pricing ~50bp cuts in 2026. Focus on upcoming FOMC minutes.
- EUR rates / ECB: Expectations anchored on steady hold through 2026; peripheral spreads stable.
- JPY / BoJ: Yields slipped after strong auction; April hike probability rising over March. USDJPY defensive.
- GBP / BoE: [No major 24h catalyst]; trading in line with broad G10 risk sentiment.
- CNY/CNH / PBoC + China: Focus shifts to onshore reopening; offshore CNH stable/stronger during holiday.

## 4) Energy & shipping
- Oil/gas narrative: Brent ~$68; weighed down by Iran deal rumors despite Middle East tensions failing to boost prices.
- Chokepoints (Hormuz, Red Sea/Suez, Taiwan Strait): Red Sea rerouting persists (status quo); no new major kinetic event in Hormuz.
- Inflation implication: Lower oil inputs net disinflationary if sustained; shipping costs remain the offset.

## 5) Sanctions / export controls / policy actions
- **US-Iran Diplomacy** (Unconfirmed): Potential thaw could lead to sanctions enforcement relaxation discussions (market pricing probability > 0). [Sanctions]

## 8) Linear issue drafts (max 3)
### Issue draft
Title: Verify US-Iran Geneva Talks Sources
Labels: [Energy][Geopolitics][SourceGap]
Problem: Market moving (>2% oil drop) on "Geneva talks" reports without primary official source (State Dept/Iran MFA).
Evidence: Saxo/XTB/Reuters citations of "talks" vs lack of official statement.
Proposed fix (file + exact change): Update `sources.md` to include specific Iranian MFA English feeds or State Dept press briefing schedule.
