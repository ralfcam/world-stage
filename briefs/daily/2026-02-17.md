## 8) Linear issue drafts (max 3)
### Issue draft
Title: Refine Chokepoint Trigger for "Signaling"
Labels: [Energy][Workflow]
Problem: "Military exercises" in Hormuz moved Oil +1.4% but didn't strictly meet "Kinetic incident/blockade" trigger in `triggers.yml`.
Evidence: Iran exercises 2026-02-16 moved Brent despite no shots fired.
Proposed fix (file + exact change): In `triggers.yml`, under `chokepoint_disruption`, add condition "OR major military signaling/exercises in theater".
