Meta: timezone=Europe/Zurich; lookback=24h

## 1) Top 5 market-moving developments
1. Oil trades sideways into US–Iran nuclear talks → Channels: Energy/Inflation → Why now: headline risk can reprice crude risk premium quickly → Watch (24–72h): talk headlines, any signals on supply/sanctions posture  Continuity: New (ref: 2026-02-15)  [Energy][Inflation]
2. Oil balance narrative tug-of-war (IEA vs OPEC-style outlook gap) → Channels: Energy/Inflation → Why now: narrative shifts can move positioning and term structure even absent a shock → Watch (24–72h): official monthly report headlines and revisions  Continuity: Ongoing (ref: 2026-02-15)  [Energy][Inflation]
3. US rates remain the core transmission channel; latest available 10Y print shows recent downside drift → Channels: Rates/FX → Why now: lower yields can ease financial conditions and lean USD tone → Watch (24–72h): heavy Fed-speaker calendar, any data that re-prices the front end  Continuity: Ongoing (ref: 2026-02-15)  [Rates][FX]
4. China FX management remains a live macro lever; near-term onshore holiday reduces visibility/liquidity → Channels: FX/Liquidity/Growth → Why now: fixing/pace-management can anchor regional FX and risk sentiment → Watch (24–72h): CNH pricing during holiday, any PBoC signaling via midpoint/fix framing  Continuity: Ongoing (ref: 2026-02-15)  [FX][Liquidity][Growth]
5. Red Sea risk remains an embedded tail for freight, delivery times, and energy risk premium → Channels: Shipping/Energy/Inflation → Why now: any confirmed incident/advisory can reprice insurance and rerouting assumptions → Watch (24–72h): official advisories, credible incident reporting, carrier routing updates  Continuity: Ongoing (ref: 2026-02-15)  [Shipping][Energy][Inflation]

## 2) Confirmed vs Reported
### Confirmed (primary-source)
- Oil prices drift/hold steady ahead of US–Iran nuclear talks (https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/oil-drifts-ahead-us-iran-nuclear-talks-2026-02-16/) — headline risk is the near-term driver of risk premium and inflation impulse. [Energy][Inflation]
- 10Y UST constant-maturity series shows 4.09 on 2026-02-12 vs 4.18 on 2026-02-11 (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DGS10) — confirms recent rates downside momentum in the latest available official series. [Rates]

### Reported (secondary)
- IEA vs Opec split on "what comes next for oil" (https://www.thenationalnews.com/business/energy/2026/02/16/why-the-iea-and-opec-are-split-on-what-comes-next-for-oil/) — magnitude/direction of 2026 balance is disputed; watch for revisions and market reaction rather than levels. [Energy][Inflation]
- Red Sea remains a high-risk corridor with ongoing diversion behavior (https://trans.info/en/red-sea-return-2026-447916) — timing of "normalization" remains uncertain and can swing freight and delivery assumptions. [Shipping][Inflation]

## 3) Rates & FX scoreboard
- USD rates / Fed: Latest available 10Y in the official constant-maturity series is 4.09 (2026-02-12) after 4.18 (2026-02-11), keeping the "rates down / conditions easier" framing in play. Fed-speaker risk is elevated this week per the event-calendar note; watch for any pivot language that re-prices the 2Y/terminal narrative.
- EUR rates / ECB: No primary-source ECB item captured in the current source set; keep focus on Bund direction and any fragmentation headlines that would widen BTP-Bund as a transmission channel per baseline indicators.
- JPY / BoJ: No primary-source BoJ item captured in the current source set; watch JPY as the "carry unwind" barometer if global vol rises.
- GBP / BoE: No primary-source BoE item captured in the current source set; keep an eye on UK rates sensitivity to global rates moves.
- CNY/CNH / PBoC + China: Mainland markets are closed Feb 16–23 (Lunar New Year), which can shift price discovery to offshore venues. Recent context: PBoC midpoint management has been used to guide pace as CNY strength builds, a reminder that FX is an active policy lever.

## 4) Energy & shipping
- Oil/gas narrative: Oil is trading sideways into US–Iran talks; the near-term driver is headlines and implied risk premium rather than a confirmed physical disruption. The competing "surplus vs demand growth" framing adds positioning risk around official report cycles.
- Chokepoints (Hormuz, Red Sea/Suez, Taiwan Strait): Red Sea remains treated as high risk in industry commentary; any confirmed incident/advisory is the fast path to freight/insurance repricing.
- Inflation implication: Energy risk premium + sustained rerouting is the cleanest short-horizon path from geopolitics/shipping into inflation narratives per indicators baseline.

## 5) Sanctions / export controls / policy actions
- Placeholder (add primary link): monitor for any binding sanctions/export-control actions tied to energy, banking, shipping, or strategic tech that meet the "market channel within 1–3 sessions" bar. [Sanctions][ExportControls]

## 6) Watchlist tiles (Tier 1 then Tier 2)
### US
Signals (3):
- Rates downside momentum in latest available official series keeps "conditions easier" in play.

- Any escalation that transmits via energy/shipping/sanctions.

## 7) Mindmap updates
Add nodes (≤3):
- US–Iran nuclear talks (headline risk)
- Lunar New Year onshore closure (China liquidity/visibility)
- Red Sea "normalization uncertainty" (routing/insurance regime)

Add edges (≤5):
- US–Iran talks → Oil risk premium (label: headline-driven repricing)
- Oil risk premium → Inflation narrative (label: pass-through)
- China market closure → CNH price discovery (label: offshore-led)
- Red Sea risk → Freight/insurance costs (label: rerouting regime)
- Freight/energy → Rates expectations (label: inflation channel)

## 8) Linear issue drafts (max 3)
### Issue draft
Title:
- Add explicit "market holidays/liquidity" signal to China tile
Labels:
- [FX][Liquidity][CoverageChange]
Problem:
- The brief template/watchlist doesn't explicitly force a "market holiday / liquidity constraint" note, which can distort interpretation of CNH/CNY moves during closures.
Evidence:
- China markets closure Feb 16–23 (Lunar New Year) is called out as a key near-term constraint in the week-ahead note.
Proposed fix (file + exact change):
- `watchlist.yml` (or Space canonical `watchlist.txt`): under CN key_questions add a line, "Are market holidays/liquidity constraints shifting price discovery to offshore CNH?"
Success criteria:
- For every onshore closure week, the China tile includes a 1-line liquidity/price-discovery caveat and a clear "what would change my mind" trigger.
