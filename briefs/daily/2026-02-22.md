## 8) Linear issue drafts (max 3)
### Issue draft
Title: Add "Diplomatic Track" questions to Watchlist (RU/UA)
Labels: Geopolitics, CoverageChange
Problem: "Peace talks" narrative is surfacing as a driver for strikes, but `watchlist.yml` focuses only on Defense/Sanctions/Energy for RU/UA.
Evidence: Reuters connects Feb 21 strikes to "before talks" posturing.
Proposed fix (file + exact change): In `watchlist.yml` under RU and UA, add key_question: "Any credible signal of ceasefire/peace talks?"
