## 8) Linear issue drafts (max 3)
### Issue draft
Title: Trigger Gap: Pre-emptive Military Mobilization
Labels: Geopolitics, TriggerTuning
Problem: "US preparing for weeks-long operations" is a massive signal but `direct_escalation` requires "strikes" and `chokepoint_disruption` requires "incident".
Evidence: Reuters exclusive on US-Iran plans.
Proposed fix (file + exact change): Add `pre_kinetic_mobilization` to `triggers.yml` under `conflict`.
