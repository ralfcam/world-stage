## 1) Top 5 market-moving developments
1. US CPI Disinflation (2.4%) → Channels: [Rates][Inflation] → Why now: Headline CPI 2.4% (vs 2.5% exp); Core 2.5%. Yields drop (10Y <4.07%) as disinflation narrative solidifies. → Watch (24–72h): Fed speaker reaction (Bostic/Williams). Continuity: Ongoing (ref: 2026-02-13). [Rates][Inflation]

3. Oil Stabilization ($67.80) → Channels: [Energy] → Why now: Brent bounces (+0.4%) from "war trade unwind" lows ($67.30). Market skepticism on swift US-Iran deal; inventory build ignored. → Watch (24–72h): Red Sea shipping updates. Continuity: Reversal (ref: 2026-02-13). [Energy]

5. US Growth Scare (Retail Sales + CPI) → Channels: [Macro][Equities] → Why now: Soft retail sales (prior) + cooling CPI = "Bad News is Good News" for rates, but "Bad News" for earnings? → Watch (24–72h): PPI data. Continuity: Ongoing (ref: 2026-02-13). [Macro][Equities]

## 2) Confirmed vs Reported
### Confirmed (primary-source)

- Geneva Talks Dates (Feb 17-18) (Kremlin/Kyiv) — Official confirmation of venue and delegations. [Geopolitics]

- GBP / BoE: [Stable].
- CNY/CNH / PBoC + China: Stable/Strong.

## 4) Energy & shipping
- Oil/gas narrative: Stabilizing ~$68. "Peace Premium" pricing out, but "Impasse" floor kicking in.
- Chokepoints (Hormuz, Red Sea/Suez, Taiwan Strait): USS Gerald R. Ford redirected to Middle East.
- Inflation implication: Energy deflation aids CPI miss.

## 8) Linear issue drafts (max 3)
### Issue draft
Title: Add De-escalation trigger to Conflict
Labels: Geopolitics, TriggerTuning
Problem: Triggers only cover "Escalation". Market pricing "Peace" (Geneva talks) requires new sensitivity.
Evidence: Oil volatility on "Talks" headlines.
Proposed fix (file + exact change): In triggers.yml, add `id: de_escalation` under `conflict` category.
