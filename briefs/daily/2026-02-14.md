## 2) Confirmed vs Reported
### Confirmed (primary-source)
- US January CPI: 2.4% YoY, 0.2% MoM ([BLS](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm)) — Below consensus; core 2.5% (lowest since 2021). [Rates][Inflation]
- Fed January FOMC: Held rates at 3.5%-3.75% ([Fed](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20260128a.htm)) — Two dissents for 25bp cut. [Rates]
- ECB February: Held rates; inflation at 2% target ([ECB](https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/press_conference/visual-mps/2026/html/mopo_statement_explained_february.en.html)) — "Steady path"; services driving growth. [Rates]
- BoE February: Held Bank Rate at 3.75% (5-4 vote) ([BoE](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/monetary-policy-report/2026/february-2026)) — Four members voted for 25bp cut. [Rates]

### Reported (secondary)

## 3) Rates & FX scoreboard
- **USD rates / Fed**: CPI miss (2.4% vs 2.5% consensus) triggered dovish repricing. Market now pricing higher probability of rate cuts in H1 2026. Fed held in January with two dissents for easing. Next move: speakers' reactions to CPI data will clarify March path.

- **EUR rates / ECB**: ECB held rates in February; inflation at 2% target. Services driving growth; defense/infrastructure spending supportive. Bank lending improving. Policy guidance: "Steady path" with inflation stabilized.

- **JPY / BoJ**: JPY strengthening materially (~3.6% over past month); USD/JPY ~152.8. Verbal intervention from Tokyo continues. PM Takaichi's expansionary fiscal agenda adding complexity. JGB curve flattening persists. Carry-trade unwind risk elevated.

- **GBP / BoE**: Bank Rate held at 3.75% (5-4 vote in February); four members voted for 25bp cut. Policy guidance: "Bank Rate is likely to be reduced further" but "judgements around further easing will become a closer call."

- **CNY/CNH / PBoC + China**: Yuan at multi-year highs; USD/CNY ~6.91 (Yuan up ~4.9% over 12 months). Strong capital inflow signal or broad USD weakness. PBoC fixing response critical; market watching for managed depreciation.

## 4) Energy & shipping
- **Oil/gas narrative**: Oil recovered to ~$68-69/bbl after crashing to ~$63 on Feb 13 de-escalation trade. US-Iran Oman talks stalled with no breakthrough; market skepticism rising. Oil volatility reflects geopolitical uncertainty premium returning.

- **Chokepoints (Hormuz, Red Sea/Suez, Taiwan Strait)**: No new kinetic incidents reported. Hormuz risk premium subdued despite stalled diplomacy. Red Sea/Suez stable. Taiwan Strait quiet.

- **Inflation implication**: Oil recovery from lows (+~8-10% from Feb 2 bottom) moderates disinflationary impulse. However, CPI data shows energy/food slowdown already feeding through to headline. Net effect: neutral to slightly inflationary if oil stabilizes above $70.

## 5) Sanctions / export controls / policy actions
- **No major new actions reported in last 24h.** Monitoring for any US/EU response to stalled Iran talks.

## 8) Linear issue drafts (max 3)
### Issue draft 1
**Title**: Add primary CNY data sources to watchlist.yml

**Labels**: FX, SourceGap, Watchlist

**Problem**: CNY narrative is recurring Top-5 item but baseline_sources_hint for CN in watchlist.yml (["pbc.gov.cn", "stats.gov.cn"]) lacks direct CNY fixing/FX policy sources.

**Evidence**: 
- Feb 13-14 briefs elevated CNY strength to Top-5
- Relied on secondary sources (TradingEconomics, X-Rates)
- PBoC fixing is critical trigger but source not specified

**Proposed fix (file + exact change)**: 
In `watchlist.yml`, CN entry, update `baseline_sources_hint` from:
```yaml
baseline_sources_hint: ["pbc.gov.cn", "stats.gov.cn"]
```
to:
```yaml
baseline_sources_hint: ["pbc.gov.cn", "stats.gov.cn", "safe.gov.cn", "chinamoney.com.cn"]
```

**Success criteria**: Future briefs cite PBoC fixing/SAFE FX data directly.

### Issue draft 2
**Title**: Refine continuity labeling for "Reversal" events

**Labels**: TemplateFix, LinearOps

**Problem**: Today's brief marks CPI as "Reversal (ref: 2026-02-13)" but yesterday's brief listed "US January CPI" as a *future* event (not an active narrative). Reversal should reference an *active* narrative that flipped, not a scheduled event.

**Evidence**: 
- Feb 14 brief: "CPI Miss... Continuity: Reversal (ref: 2026-02-13 — CPI anxiety resolved)"
- Feb 13 brief: "US January CPI → Release due 14:30 CET" (item #2, not active narrative)

**Proposed fix (file + exact change)**: 
In `daily_template.md`, clarify continuity labeling:
```markdown
## Continuity labeling rules:
- **New**: First appearance as Top-5 item.
- **Ongoing**: Active narrative from prior brief(s); cite last anchor date.
- **Reversal**: Active narrative that *flipped direction*; must reference prior narrative (not scheduled event).
  - Example: "Gold Rally" reversing "Gold Selloff" (both were narratives).
  - Counter-example: "CPI Miss" is NOT a reversal of "CPI Release" (the release was an event, not a narrative).
```

**Success criteria**: Future briefs use "Reversal" only when prior narrative existed and flipped.

### Issue draft 3
**Title**: Add "Stalled/Faded" continuity status for diplomacy narratives

**Labels**: TemplateFix, Geopolitics

**Problem**: US-Iran diplomacy is marked "Ongoing" but market is pricing in failure. Current continuity taxonomy (New/Ongoing/Reversal) doesn't capture "stalled but not reversed" state.

**Evidence**: 
- Feb 14 brief: "US-Iran Diplomacy Stalled... Continuity: Ongoing (ref: 2026-02-13 — initial rally fading)"
- Oil recovered (not reversed); gold safe-haven bid (not reversed); but narrative momentum lost.

**Proposed fix (file + exact change)**: 
In `daily_template.md`, expand continuity options:
```markdown
Continuity: New | Ongoing | Stalled | Reversal (ref: YYYY-MM-DD)
```
Add definition:
- **Stalled**: Narrative momentum lost but not reversed; market pricing in failure or delay.

**Success criteria**: Diplomacy/negotiation narratives can be marked "Stalled" when appropriate.
