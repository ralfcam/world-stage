## 1) Top 5 market-moving developments
1. US Jan CPI Miss (+2.4% vs 2.5% exp) → Channels: [Rates][Equities][FX] → Continuity: New (ref: 2026-02-13) → Why now: Inflation cooling faster than expected (Headline 2.4%); yields dip (10Y -4bps to 4.07%), S&P 500 rallies (+0.6%). → Watch (24–72h): Fed speaker reaction (dove pivot?).

Gold Breakout >$5,000 (+2.5%) → Channels: [Commodities][FX] → Continuity: Reversal (ref: 2026-02-13) → Why now: Sharp reversal from yesterday’s "de-escalation" selloff; fueled by lower real yields (post-CPI) and lingering geopolitical hedge demand. → Watch (24–72h): Close >$5050 confirmation. [Metals]
3. US-Iran Diplomacy "Reality Check" → Channels: [Energy][Geopolitics] → Continuity: Ongoing (ref: 2026-02-13) → Why now: No official treaty text materialized; Oil stabilized (~$67.80, +0.4%) after Thursday’s drop; skepticism on "breakthrough" grows. → Watch (24–72h): White House confirmation or denial of "serious talks". [Energy]
4. S&P 500 Rebound (6,873) → Channels: [Equities] → Continuity: Ongoing (ref: 2026-02-13) → Why now: Follow-through on Asian record highs and "Goldilocks" CPI print (growth ok, inflation cooling). → Watch (24–72h): Monday Asian open. [Equities]
5. USD/JPY Resilience (153.07) → Channels: [FX] → Continuity: Ongoing (ref: 2026-02-13) → Why now: Pair rose (+0.2%) despite US yield drop; suggests structural JPY weakness or carry demand remains intact. → Watch (24–72h): BoJ Governor comments. [FX]

## 2) Confirmed vs Reported
### Confirmed (primary-source)
- US CPI Jan (+0.2% MoM, +2.4% YoY) (BLS) — Undershot consensus (2.5%), driving "disinflation" narrative. [Macro]
- US 10Y Yield 4.07% (-4bps) (Market Data) — Immediate reaction to soft CPI. [Rates]

### Reported (secondary)
- "Serious Talks" US-Iran (Media) — Reports persist but lack official details; market impact fading (Oil flat). [Geopolitics]

## 3) Rates & FX scoreboard
- USD rates / Fed: Yields lower (10Y ~4.07%) on CPI miss; market pricing higher probability of Fed cut/hold.
- EUR rates / ECB: [Stable; waiting for Schnabel speech/ECB minutes].
- JPY / BoJ: USD/JPY sticky >153 despite lower US yields; JGB curve flattening continues.
- GBP / BoE: [No major inputs; tracking USD move].
- CNY/CNH / PBoC + China: CNY remains strong (3-year highs) but stabilized vs USD post-CPI.

## 4) Energy & shipping
- Oil/gas narrative: Brent stabilized ~$67.80 (+0.4%) after "diplomacy drop"; market awaiting concrete deal evidence.
- Chokepoints (Hormuz, Red Sea/Suez, Taiwan Strait): Status quo; no new kinetic escalation confirmed in last 24h.
- Inflation implication: Lower oil + CPI miss = strong disinflationary impulse.

### Issue draft
Title: Add Metals Volatility Trigger
Labels: TriggerTuning, Taxonomy
Problem: Gold moved +2.5% (major move) but triggers.yml lacks a specific "Metals/Gold" volatility trigger.
Evidence: Gold >$5,000 (+2.5%) on CPI miss.
Proposed fix (file + exact change): In triggers.yml, add `id: metals_volatility` under a new or existing category.
