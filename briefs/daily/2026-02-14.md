## 2) Confirmed vs Reported
### Confirmed (primary-source)
- BoJ Rate Hike (0.75%) (CentralBanking) — 30-year high; signals further tightening. [Rates]
- US CPI (2.4%) (BLS) — Missed consensus (2.5%); disinflationary. [Inflation]
- Gold > $5,000 (Market Data) — Historic breakout. [Commodities]

### Reported (secondary)
- "US-Iran Tensions Ease" (Mezha) — Vague reports of easing; oil dipped then recovered. [Geopolitics]

## 3) Rates & FX scoreboard
- USD rates / Fed: Yields lower on CPI miss; market pricing H1 cuts.
- EUR rates / ECB: Steady (Feb 5 hold); tracking USD moves.
- JPY / BoJ: Aggressive hike (0.75%); JGB curve bear-flattening; JPY strong.
- GBP / BoE: [No major inputs].
- CNY/CNH / PBoC + China: Strongest levels in years; PBoC likely allowing appreciation to dampen import costs.

## 4) Energy & shipping
- Oil/gas narrative: Crude rebounds to ~$67 (Brent) as "peace trade" unwinds.
- Chokepoints (Hormuz, Red Sea/Suez, Taiwan Strait): Tensions reported "easing" but skepticism remains high.

## 8) Linear issue drafts (max 3)
### Issue draft
Title: Add De-escalation trigger to Conflict
Labels: Geopolitics, TriggerTuning
Problem: Oil crashed (-3.5%) then rebounded on de-escalation news/skepticism. triggers.yml only tracks "Escalation".
Evidence: Market volatility Feb 13-14 driven by "peace talks" rumors.
Proposed fix (file + exact change): In triggers.yml, add `id: de_escalation` under `conflict` category.
