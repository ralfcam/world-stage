## 2) Confirmed vs Reported
### Confirmed (primary-source)
- US Treasury Yields (Treasury.gov) — 10Y eased to 4.10% on data. [Rates]
- PBoC Open Market Operations (PBOC/Media) — Large liquidity net injection confirmed. [Liquidity]

### Reported (secondary)
- Fed-Treasury "Accord" (Media/Analysis) — Speculative framework for debt management; no official policy yet. [Policy]
- Middle East "Tensions" (Media) — General attribution for oil price support without specific new kinetic event in last 12h. [Geopolitics]

## 3) Rates & FX scoreboard
- USD rates / Fed: 10Y yield ~4.10%. Market pricing in softness after jobless data. Focus on "Accord" narrative.
- EUR rates / ECB: Yields stable; ECB committed to data-dependence. Tariff risks to growth dampening yields.
- JPY / BoJ: BoJ monitoring "carry unwind" risks; no immediate policy shift signal overnight.
- GBP / BoE: Digesting recent 5-4 split vote; markets seeing 50% chance of March cut.
- CNY/CNH / PBoC + China: Heavy liquidity support ($87B equiv) dominates narrative; LNY holiday dampens volume.

## 4) Energy & shipping
- Oil/gas narrative: Brent ~$69.60. Bullish geopolitical premium vs bearish global supply glut (OPEC+ pause).
- Chokepoints (Hormuz, Red Sea/Suez, Taiwan Strait): No new specific blockades confirmed overnight, but tension high.
- Inflation implication: Oil resilience at ~$70 limits disinflation impulse.

## 5) Sanctions / export controls / policy actions
- None major overnight.

## 8) Linear issue drafts (max 3)
### Issue draft
Title: Add primary source for Warsh/Bessent Accord talks
Labels: [Policy][SourceGap]
Problem: "Fed-Treasury Accord" is moving markets (narrative) but relies on secondary media analysis.
Evidence: Web search results cite "talks resurfacing" without official doc.
Proposed fix (file + exact change): Add specific Treasury/Fed press link to `watchlist.yml` sources if available, or tag as "Narrative" in `taxonomy.csv`.
