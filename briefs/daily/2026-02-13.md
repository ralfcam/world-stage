# Daily Market-Mover Brief — 2026-02-13 (CET)
Meta: timezone=Europe/Zurich; lookback=24h

## 1) Top 5 market-moving developments
1. **Global AI/Tech trade suffers worst session of 2026 (Nasdaq -2%) on capex jitters** → Channels: Equities/Volatility/Growth → Why now: Earnings misses (Cisco -12%, AppLovin -20%) reignited fears that AI infrastructure costs are outrunning revenue, triggering a broad rotation out of mega-cap tech and dragging the S&P 500 lower. → Watch (24–72h): Close-of-week flows, whether the selloff widens to broader credit spreads, and if "buy-the-dip" retail flows emerge. [Equities][Volatility][Growth]
2. **Oil drops ~$2/bbl as IEA forecasts surplus and geopolitical risk premium fades** → Channels: Energy/Inflation/Diplomacy → Why now: IEA monthly report sees 2026 supply outpacing demand, while markets priced out immediate Hormuz escalation risks following comments that Trump and Netanyahu are "framing a resolution" to the Iran nuclear standoff. → Watch (24–72h): WTI holding $60 support, any denial of the "resolution" narrative from Tehran, and weekly rig count data. [Energy][Diplomacy][Inflation]
3. **US Jobless Claims (227k) reinforce "no-landing" labor backdrop** → Channels: Rates/USD/Growth → Why now: Initial claims dropped 5k, unwinding weather-related noise and confirming the NFP signal that the labor market remains too tight to force the Fed's hand on immediate cuts, keeping 10Y yields elevated near 4.10–4.18%. → Watch (24–72h): Fed speakers today (checking for "patience" messaging) and next week's inflation expectations data. [Rates][Growth][USD]
4. **ECB explicitly prepares to broaden access to "Euro Backstop" liquidity facilities** → Channels: Liquidity/Regulation/Euro → Why now: Board member Piero Cipollone confirmed work to expand access for non-euro central banks, signaling a proactive stance to prevent offshore funding freezes from blowing back into the eurozone amid global fragmentation risks. → Watch (24–72h): Official details at Munich Security Conference and any reaction in EUR cross-currency basis swaps. [Liquidity][Regulation][FX]
5. **Russia launches missile barrage on Kyiv as peace-talk hopes stall** → Channels: Defense/Geopolitics/Energy → Why now: Large-scale overnight strikes targeted infrastructure, with President Zelensky stating Moscow is "hesitating" on US-brokered talks, dampening the "early ceasefire" optimism that had compressed European risk premia earlier in the week. → Watch (24–72h): Damage assessments to Ukrainian energy grid and any retaliatory drone strikes on Russian refineries. [Defense][Geopolitics][Energy]

## 2) Confirmed vs Reported
### Confirmed (primary-source)
- **US Department of Labor (DOL)** — Initial Jobless Claims fell to 227,000 (vs 232,000 prior), stabilizing after winter weather distortions and maintaining a sub-230k trend consistent with tight employment. [Rates][Growth]
- **International Energy Agency (IEA)** — Monthly Oil Market Report projects global oil supply will exceed demand in 2026, citing robust non-OPEC+ output growth. [Energy][Growth]
- **Cisco Systems (Earnings)** — Reported rising AI infrastructure costs and softer enterprise demand, triggering a 12% stock decline and weighing on the broader hardware sector. [Equities][SupplyChains]
- **ECB (Cipollone)** — Confirmed preparation of expanded euro backstop facilities to support international liquidity stability. [Liquidity][Policy]

### Reported (secondary)
- **Diplomatic sources (via media)** — Suggest PM Netanyahu and President Trump are aligning on a "resolution framework" for the Iran nuclear file, which algos read as a de-escalation signal (compressing the war-risk premium), though no official text exists. [Diplomacy][Energy][Sanctions]
- **Market commentary** — Attributed the tech selloff to "AI fatigue" and rotation, though flow data on whether this is institutional de-risking or just tactical hedging remains anecdotal. [Equities][Volatility]

## 3) Rates & FX scoreboard
- **USD rates / Fed**: The curve remains bear-flattened with 10Y yields holding ground near 4.18% (despite a small dip to 4.10% on risk-off) as the 227k claims print validates the "patience" narrative. Futures continue to price out near-term cuts, waiting for a definitive break in data or a financial accident (e.g., tech rout deepening) to shift the reaction function.
- **EUR rates / ECB**: Bunds are essentially collateral damage to the US move, trading in tight ranges. The focus is shifting to the "backstop" facility news, which is marginally supportive for peripheral spreads (BTP-Bund) by promising a liquidity safety net, even as the rate path remains on hold.
- **JPY / BoJ**: USD/JPY is choppy, caught between US yield support and risk-off flows that typically favor the yen. With the Nikkei finally cracking (tracking the US tech drop), there is a risk of a "volatility feedback loop" where falling stocks force margin unwinds, potentially strengthening JPY further if carry trades are liquidated.
- **GBP / BoE**: Sterling remains resilient but rangebound. No major domestic catalysts in the last 24h; price action is largely a beta to the USD and global risk sentiment.
- **CNY/CNH / PBoC + China**: The yuan's strength (USD/CNY ~6.90) persists, effectively anchoring Asian FX. The "AI capex" selloff in the US creates a mixed backdrop for China tech: bad for sentiment, but potentially good if capital rotates back into "undervalued" EM assets (though trade war risks keep a lid on this).

## 4) Energy & shipping
- **Oil/gas narrative**: Brent gave up the "Hormuz premium" quickly, dropping ~$2 to test $62–64 levels. The driver is the IEA's "surplus 2026" call combined with the "Trump-Netanyahu resolution" headline. The market has flipped from "fear of supply cut" to "fear of demand glut" in 24 hours.
- **Chokepoints**:
    - **Hormuz**: Tensions linger (MARAD advisory still active), but the *market pricing* of the risk collapsed on the diplomatic headlines. No new kinetic events confirmed in the last 24h.
    - **Red Sea**: Quiet but structural risk remains high.
- **Inflation implication**: The drop in oil is a direct disinflationary impulse, offsetting some of the "sticky services" fear from the US labor data. If sustained, this lowers the headline CPI ceiling for March.

## 5) Sanctions / export controls / policy actions
- **ECB Liquidity Backstop Expansion** (Primary: ECB): The ECB is moving to formalize swap/repo lines for non-euro central banks. → **Market channel**: Reduces the "right-tail" risk of a euro funding squeeze during geopolitical shocks, capping volatility in EUR cross-basis. [Liquidity][Regulation]
- **Russia Missile Strikes** (Primary: UA Gov): Kinetic escalation continues despite talk of talks. → **Market channel**: Sustains the "war discount" on European assets and keeps defense sector bids active. [Defense][Geopolitics]

## 6) Watchlist tiles (Tier 1 then Tier 2)
### United States (US)
**Signals (3):**
- **Tech/AI Rout**: Nasdaq -2% drop signals a potential shift in market leadership/regime; VIX spikes.
- **Jobless Claims**: 227k print confirms labor market resilience (no recession signal yet).
- **Yield Resilience**: 10Y refusing to break lower despite the equity drop suggests the "higher for longer" rates view is entrenched.
**Key uncertainty (1):**
- Will the equity selloff trigger a "reverse wealth effect" or financial conditions tightening that finally forces the Fed to soften its tone?
**Triggers (24–72h) (3):**
- **Close-of-week equity flows**: A second day of -2% would trigger margin calls.
- **Fed Speak**: Any acknowledgement of the equity volatility?
- **Consumer Sentiment (Friday)**: Will the stock drop hit confidence?

### Euro area (EA)
**Signals (3):**
- **Liquidity Backstop**: Proactive plumbing work by ECB (Cipollone).
- **Yield Stability**: Sovereign spreads ignoring the risk-off tone so far.
- **Currency**: EUR/USD stuck in range, unable to capitalize on US tech weakness.
**Key uncertainty (1):**
- Is the ECB preparing the backstop because they see a specific stress event (e.g., banks exposed to Russia/China) coming?
**Triggers (24–72h) (3):**
- **Munich Security Conference**: Expect comments on Ukraine aid and defense bonds.
- **Lagarde Speeches**: Any hint of diverging from the "pause" stance?
- **Energy prices**: If oil stays down, ECB dovishness could creep back.

### China (CN)
**Signals (3):**
- **CNY Strength**: Persisting despite the strong USD backdrop.
- **Tech Spillover**: US AI rout likely to weigh on Asian tech/semis at the open.
- **Liquidity**: Continued pre-LNY injections.
**Key uncertainty (1):**
- Does the US tech selloff accelerate export controls (by highlighting "AI arms race" costs) or distract Washington?
**Triggers (24–72h) (3):**
- **PBoC Fixing**: Will they let CNY weaken to absorb the trade shock?
- **LNY Travel Data**: Early reads on consumption.
- **Geopolitics**: Any opportunistic moves in SCS while US is focused on markets/Iran?

## 7) Mindmap updates
**Add nodes (≤3):**
- **AI Capex Fatigue** (Market narrative shift: costs > revenue).
- **ECB Euro Backstop** (Policy tool: anti-fragmentation for non-EU).
- **IEA 2026 Surplus** (Fundamental anchor: bearish oil).

**Add edges (≤5):**
- **AI Capex Fatigue** → **Nasdaq** (label: "valuation compression").
- **IEA 2026 Surplus** → **Brent Crude** (label: "capped upside / $60 anchor").
- **Diplomatic "Resolution" Rumors** → **Hormuz Risk Premium** (label: "volatility collapse").
- **ECB Euro Backstop** → **Euro Funding Stress** (label: "pre-emptive mitigation").

## 8) Linear issue drafts (max 3)
### Issue draft 1
**Title:**
Refine "Chokepoint Disruption" trigger to handle volatility of de-escalation rumors
**Labels:**
[Energy][Geopolitics][LinearOps][TriggerTuning]
**Problem:**
The current `chokepoint_disruption` trigger focuses on kinetic incidents. However, we saw a ~2% oil price reversal solely on *rumors* of a diplomatic "resolution" (Netanyahu/Trump), which isn't explicitly captured. We miss the "volatility collapse" trade that is just as actionable as the spike.
**Evidence:**
- Oil dropped ~$2/bbl on Feb 12 despite no change in physical flow, driven by secondary reports of diplomatic framing.
- The brief had to lean on "Reported" sources to explain the move.
**Proposed fix (file + exact change):**
- Update `triggers.yml` under `energy_shipping`: Add a `de_escalation_shock` trigger. Condition: "Credible diplomatic breakthrough or rumor that unwinds >50% of a recent geopolitical risk premium in <24h." Promote: [Energy, Volatility, SA, IR].
**Success criteria:**
- The system automatically flags "peace rumors" that crash oil prices as Top-5 drivers, ensuring we capture the *unwinding* of risk just as aggressively as the buildup.
