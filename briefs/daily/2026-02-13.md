## 2) Confirmed vs Reported
### Confirmed (primary-source)
- US January Payrolls (+130k) (Saxo) — Stronger labor market context ahead of CPI. [Macro]
- US Retail Sales (Soft) (Reuters) — "Unexpectedly soft" data pressuring yields. [Macro]

### Reported (secondary)
- "Renewed diplomacy" US-Iran (MarketPulse) — Market pricing major de-escalation (Oil -3.5%), but no official treaty text. [Geopolitics]

## 3) Rates & FX scoreboard
- USD rates / Fed: Yields lower on soft retail sales; market holding breath for CPI. Fed reaction function hinges on today's print.
- EUR rates / ECB: Tracking USD moves; periphery spreads stable.
- JPY / BoJ: JGB curve flattening; JPY strengthening (~1% vs USD).
- GBP / BoE: [No major inputs; tracking global beta].
- CNY/CNH / PBoC + China: CNY at 3-year high; strong capital inflow signal or dollar weakness play.

## 4) Energy & shipping
- Oil/gas narrative: Crude crashes below $63/bbl on "war trade unwind" (US-Iran talks).
- Chokepoints (Hormuz, Red Sea/Suez, Taiwan Strait): No new kinetic escalation reported; market pricing in safety.
- Inflation implication: Sharp drop in energy/metals inputs is disinflationary for headline.

### Issue draft
Title: Add De-escalation trigger to Conflict
Labels: Geopolitics, TriggerTuning
Problem: Oil crashed due to de-escalation news, but triggers.yml only captures "Escalation".
Evidence: MarketPulse report on US-Iran talks -> Oil -3.5%.
Proposed fix (file + exact change): In triggers.yml, add `id: de_escalation` under `conflict` category.
