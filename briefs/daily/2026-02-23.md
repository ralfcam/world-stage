## 2) Confirmed vs Reported
### Confirmed (primary-source)
- US Supreme Court [Opinion 25-14772](https://www.supremecourt.gov/) — Voids Executive Order on national emergency tariffs; limits presidential economic power. [Policy]
- President Zelenskyy [Statement](https://president.gov.ua) — Confirms massive overnight attack on energy grid & railway infrastructure (Feb 22). [Defense]
- Fed Calendar [FederalReserve.gov](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/calendar.htm) — Gov Waller speaks Monday Feb 23 regarding economic outlook. [Rates]

### Reported (secondary)
- "48-Hour Ultimatum" [Modern.az/Diplomatic Sources](https://modern.az) — Reports US deadline for Iran proposal before military targeting of leadership. [Geopolitics]
- "Protests in Mashhad/Tehran" [Guardian/Social Media](https://www.theguardian.com) — Reports of renewed student clashes with Basij militia. [Politics]

## 3) Rates & FX scoreboard
- USD rates / Fed: Focus on Waller (Mon) & PCE (Fri). SCOTUS ruling likely trims inflation breakevens (tariff removal).
- EUR rates / ECB: Bunds watching Ukraine energy strikes impact on EU power/gas prices.
- JPY / BoJ: Holiday (Emperor's Birthday) limits liquidity; watching USDJPY for SCOTUS reaction.
- GBP / BoE: Quiet start; monitoring risk sentiment spillover from US tariff reversal.
- CNY/CNH / PBoC: Tariff removal is positive for CNH; watching fixing for confirmation of easing pressure.

## 4) Energy & shipping
- Oil/gas narrative: WTI ~$63-66; caught between Iran escalation risk (bullish) and OPEC+ oversupply/tariff-removal demand boost (mixed).
- Chokepoints: Red Sea transit test (Gemini) is the critical watchlist item. Ukraine grid attacks pressure EU energy security.
- Inflation implication: Tariff removal is disinflationary; energy grid strikes are inflationary (supply shock).

## 5) Sanctions / export controls / policy actions
- Taiwan [President Lai Offer](https://mofa.gov.tw) — Offers talks with Ukraine to crack down on sanctions-busting (semis/parts). → Market channel: Tech supply chain tightening. [Sanctions]

## 8) Linear issue drafts (max 3)
### Issue draft
Title: Refine Policy Triggers for Judicial Reversals (SCOTUS)
Labels: Policy, Workflow
Problem: Triggers.yml focuses on policy *enactment* (tariffs/sanctions). SCOTUS striking down tariffs (Feb 20) was a massive driver missed by standard "action" triggers.
Evidence: SCOTUS 6-3 ruling vs Trump tariffs caused macro repricing (futures/Asia) without a "new policy" trigger firing.
Proposed fix (file + exact change): Add `judicial_reversal` to `triggers.yml` under `domestic_politics` or `trade`.
