## 2) Confirmed vs Reported
### Confirmed (primary-source)
- Fed Minutes (Jan 27-28) (federalreserve.gov): Voted 10-2 to hold at 3.50-3.75%; discussion of "upward adjustments" if disinflation stalls. [Rates]
- US-Iran Geneva Talks (State Dept/Iran MFA): "Guiding principles" reached; no imminent deal but diplomatic path open. [Geopolitics]
- Hapag-Lloyd/Maersk Press Release (hapag-lloyd.com): Gemini cooperation to attempt Red Sea transit with "naval escorts" from mid-Feb. [Shipping]

### Reported (secondary)
- "Surprise Shift" (Bloomberg): Characterization of the minutes as a major hawkish pivot vs prior consensus of cuts. [MarketSentiment]
- Saudi Guidance (OPEC sources): Rumors of potential output flexibility if prices hold <$70 (Low confidence). [Energy]

## 3) Rates & FX scoreboard
- USD rates / Fed: Hawkish shock. 10Y yields jumped to ~4.075%. Market repricing terminal rate expectations higher; "hike" tail-risk reintroduced. Next: PCE data.
- EUR rates / ECB: Bunds tracking USTs lower (yields up) but lagged. Focus on Lagarde's comments on "US trade tensions" accelerating EU reform.
- JPY / BoJ: USDJPY steady ~152-154 despite Fed hawk move, anchored by BoJ April hike expectations. Carry unwind risk remains if spread widens further.
- GBP / BoE: Gilts sensitive to global move; BoE "cautious" stance reinforces hold.
- CNY/CNH / PBoC: PBOC holding steady (3.00%); focus on liquidity injections post-LNY. CNH stable.

## 4) Energy & shipping
- Oil/gas narrative: Bearish flip. Brent ~$67.39 (-2%) on US-Iran de-escalation hopes. Supply disruption risk premium fading despite Red Sea tension.
- Chokepoints (Hormuz, Red Sea, Taiwan): Red Sea entering critical "test phase" with Gemini resumption. Taiwan Strait: "Massive" drone program announced (defensive signaling).
- Inflation implication: Lower oil offsets potential shipping freight bump; net neutral for now unless Red Sea transit fails.

## 5) Sanctions / export controls / policy actions
- US-Iran Talks (Geneva): Diplomatic channel active; potential sanctions relief discussion (unconfirmed) vs "guiding principles". Market channel: Oil supply. [Geopolitics]

## 6) Watchlist tiles (Tier 1 then Tier 2)
### United States (Fed)
Signals (3):
- Minutes: "Several" discussed hikes.
- Labor: "Downside risks... moderated".
- 10Y Yield: Spike to 4.075%.
Key uncertainty (1):
- Is the "hike" talk a comms tool or genuine policy option?
Triggers (24–72h) (3):
- Fed Speakers (pushback or confirmation?)
- PCE inflation print preview.
- 10Y break above 4.15%.

### Iran (Geopolitics)
Signals (3):
- Geneva talks progress ("guiding principles").
- Oil price negative reaction (-2%).
- Domestic hardliner signal (Supreme Leader anti-US rhetoric).
Key uncertainty (1):
- Will a kinetic spoiler event (proxy attack) derail talks?
Triggers (24–72h) (3):
- Joint statement details.
- Houthi attack on Gemini vessel (proxy signal).
- Israel reaction/statement.

## 7) Mindmap updates
Add nodes (≤3):
- Node: Fed Hike Tail-Risk (Probability > 15%)
- Node: Gemini Alliance Red Sea Test

Add edges (≤5):
- Fed Minutes → USD Rates (Strong Positive)
- US-Iran Talks → Oil Price (Negative)
- Gemini Resumption → Shipping Costs (Potential Negative/Normalization)

## 8) Linear issue drafts (max 3)
### Issue draft
Title: Refine `cb_surprise` trigger for "Minutes" events
Labels: Rates, Workflow, TriggerTuning
Problem: Current trigger focuses on "Surprise decision/emergency op". Minutes (lagged) caused major repricing today. Need to explicitly include Minutes/Transcript releases in the trigger logic.
Evidence: Feb 18 Fed Minutes caused 10Y yield spike/Bitcoin drop despite no "decision" that day.
Proposed fix (triggers.yml): Add "or significant Minutes/Transcript revelation" to `cb_surprise` condition.
