### Reported (secondary)
- US "Limited Strike" Plans (WSJ/Axios): Reports Pentagon reviewing options for "extensive" but not regime-change strikes if deadline missed. [Defense]
- Saudi Output Flex (OPEC Sources): Chatter on supply buffers if prices spike too high. [Energy]

## 3) Rates & FX scoreboard
- USD rates / Fed: 10Y ~4.08%, 2Y ~3.47%. "High for longer" pricing firm after strong Ind Prod data.
- EUR rates / ECB: Bunds closed week yielding to US directional pull. Focus shifts to Mon sentiment data.
- JPY / BoJ: USDJPY ~153. CPI miss (2.0%) caps yield upside; BoJ in wait-and-see mode.
- GBP / BoE: Gilts tracking global sovereign yields higher.
- CNY/CNH / PBoC: Stable pending Monday fixing.

## 4) Energy & shipping
- Oil/gas narrative: Brent ~$72, WTI ~$66.40. "War Premium" dominates fundamentals. Trump ultimatum = floor under prices.
- Chokepoints (Hormuz, Red Sea): Hormuz risk "Critical" (15-day clock). Red Sea: Active test by Gemini Alliance (ME11 service).
- Inflation implication: Oil spike + shipping cost floor = refined product inflation risk.

## 5) Sanctions / export controls / policy actions
- Trump Ultimatum (White House): "Maximum pressure" pivot to specific timeline. [Geopolitics]

## 6) Watchlist tiles (Tier 1 then Tier 2)
### Iran (Geopolitics)
Signals (3):
- "15-Day" Deadline set.
- Hormuz drills reported.

## 7) Mindmap updates
Add nodes (≤3):

- Node: Russia Feb 21 Energy Strike

## 8) Linear issue drafts (max 3)
### Issue draft
Title: Update triggers.yml for "Presidential Ultimatum" events
Labels: Geopolitics, Workflow, CoverageChange
Problem: Current `geopolitics` triggers focus on "Kinetic incident". Trump's "15 day" verbal threat repriced Oil ~5% without a kinetic event.
Evidence: Oil moved $67->$72 on verbal threat.
Proposed fix (file + exact change): Add `presidential_ultimatum` trigger to `conflict` section in `triggers.yml`.
