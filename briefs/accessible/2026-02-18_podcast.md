# Markets Today: February 18, 2026

## INTRO [15 seconds]

Good morning. This is your World Stage Monitor brief for Wednesday, February eighteenth, twenty twenty-six.

Today we're tracking oil's sharp drop on Iran deal rumors, Russia's escalation against Ukraine's energy grid, and shifting signals from Japan's central bank.

Let's dive in.

## SEGMENT 1: OIL DROPS ON IRAN RUMORS [50 seconds]

Oil fell more than two percent today after unconfirmed reports suggested the US and Iran are holding nuclear talks in Geneva.

This matters because oil prices include a risk premium. That's the extra cost traders pay to hedge against Middle East supply disruptions.

If these talks are real and show progress, that premium deflates. Oil drops. Inflation pressure eases. Central banks get more room to cut rates.

But here's the catch. No official statement from the State Department or Iran's foreign ministry. This is purely headline-driven.

What to watch: Official confirmation or denial within twenty four to forty eight hours. Also watch Israel's reaction. They oppose sanctions relief and any strong pushback could reverse the oil move.

Bottom line: if talks are confirmed, oil stays soft. If denied, expect a rebound.

## SEGMENT 2: RUSSIA STRIKES UKRAINE ENERGY GRID [45 seconds]

Meanwhile, Russia launched a large combined strike overnight targeting Ukraine's energy infrastructure.

This is part of an ongoing campaign to degrade power systems. The risk for markets is spillover into European energy prices.

If damage disrupts cross-border electricity flows or forces higher gas consumption, European gas prices could spike. That keeps inflation elevated and delays any central bank easing in the eurozone.

What to watch: European gas volatility over the next day or two. Also watch for any European Commission sanctions response or cold weather forecasts that tighten supply demand balances.

Bottom line: geopolitical risk keeps a floor under energy prices even as Iran rumors pull oil lower.

## SEGMENT 3: JAPAN DELAYS RATE HIKE TO APRIL [40 seconds]

In Japan, a former Bank of Japan board member signaled the central bank is more likely to raise rates in April, not March.

This matters for global carry trades. That's when investors borrow in low yielding currencies like the yen to invest in higher yielding assets elsewhere.

If the BOJ delays its hike, the yen stays weaker longer. Carry trades remain profitable. But if they accelerate, a rapid yen spike could force unwinding of these positions, sparking volatility in global equities and emerging market currencies.

What to watch: Any comments from BOJ Governor Ueda or board members. Also watch the dollar yen exchange rate. A move above one forty five would signal carry trade stress.

Bottom line: April timing means less near term risk of carry unwind.

## SEGMENT 4: FED STAYS HAWKISH, DOLLAR SUPPORTED [35 seconds]

In the US, markets now price only about fifty basis points of Fed rate cuts for twenty twenty-six. That's down from earlier expectations.

This higher for longer narrative supports the dollar by keeping its interest rate advantage over other currencies.

The next catalyst is the FOMC minutes. Look for language on inflation outlook and whether any members pushed for earlier cuts.

What to watch: Minutes release. Also watch for any Fed speakers who contradict the hawkish consensus.

Bottom line: as long as the Fed stays patient, the dollar stays bid.

## SEGMENT 5: CHINA REOPENS AFTER LUNAR NEW YEAR [30 seconds]

Finally, mainland China markets reopened today after the Lunar New Year holiday.

Traders are watching the People's Bank of China for liquidity signals. The daily fixing and reverse repo operations will show whether officials want to maintain recent yuan strength or allow some depreciation to help exporters.

During the holiday, offshore yuan stayed stable. That suggests limited capital flight pressure.

What to watch: Any gap between onshore and offshore yuan. Also watch consumption data from the holiday period.

Bottom line: smooth reopening supports regional risk sentiment.
