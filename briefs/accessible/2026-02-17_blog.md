# What Moved Markets Today: Hormuz Signaling, Japan's Growth Miss, and Tech Jitters in Europe

**Tuesday, February 17, 2026** — Today's market narrative centered on two classic drivers: energy geopolitics (via the Strait of Hormuz) and macro growth surprises (via Japan's weak Q4 GDP), with a side-plot of European tech/AI skepticism and a quiet US tape due to the Presidents' Day holiday.

Below is the accessible read: what happened, why it matters, and what to watch over the next 24–72 hours.

## 1) Hormuz Exercises: "Signaling" That Can Move Oil
**Continuity: Ongoing (ref: 2026-02-16)**

**What happened:** Iran conducted military exercises in/around the Strait of Hormuz ahead of Tuesday's US–Iran nuclear talks in Geneva.

**Why it matters:** Hormuz is a key global oil chokepoint. Even without a disruption, visible naval activity can lift the "risk premium" in crude (the extra price traders pay for the possibility of supply issues). In today's brief, Brent was described as holding around $68.70 and previously up ~1.4%, consistent with a tension "floor" rather than a spike.

**What changes the view:** A clear diplomatic path that reduces near-term sanctions/supply uncertainty would compress risk premium; conversely, kinetic escalation (incidents, interdictions, credible closure threats) would likely reprice oil and inflation expectations quickly.

## 2) Japan Q4 GDP Miss: A Complication for BoJ Normalization
**Continuity: New (ref: 2026-02-16)**

**What happened:** Japan's Q4 GDP was reported at +0.2% annualized versus +1.6% expected.

**Why it matters:** Markets have been debating whether the Bank of Japan (BoJ) can continue "normalizing" policy (moving away from ultra-easy settings) without damaging growth. A weak GDP print tilts the conversation toward caution, which can influence Japanese government bond yields (JGBs) and the yen (JPY).

**What changes the view:** Watch for BoJ governor commentary on whether the "virtuous cycle" (wage gains → consumption → inflation) still looks intact, and watch how the 10Y JGB yield responds as traders adjust timing expectations.

## 3) European Tech/AI Jitters: A Rotation Warning Light
**Continuity: New (ref: 2026-02-16)**

**What happened:** The brief flagged European tech/AI skepticism, with the DAX down ~0.5% and Siemens down ~6% on doubts about AI-driven profit expectations, while broader European indices were steadier.

**Why it matters:** This is less about one stock and more about positioning. When "AI optimism" is a crowded trade, any earnings or guidance disappointment can trigger sector rotation (money moving from tech/industrials into defensives) and can spill into US tech sentiment—especially when US futures re-open after a holiday.

**What changes the view:** Watch for follow-through in European industrial/tech names and any immediate spillover into US tech futures once liquidity normalizes.

## 4) US Yields + Soft CPI Digest: The "Cuts Priced In" Theme
**Continuity: Ongoing (ref: 2026-02-13)**

**What happened:** US cash markets were closed Monday for Presidents' Day, but the brief notes that Friday ended with the 10Y around 4.07% (a two-month low) after soft CPI was cited at 2.4%.

**Why it matters:** Lower yields generally loosen financial conditions (cheaper financing, higher present values for equities) and can soften the dollar (USD) by narrowing rate differentials. The near-term risk is communications: if the Fed pushes back on "deeper cuts," the front end (2Y/terminal pricing) can reprice fast.

**What changes the view:** Next catalysts are Fed speakers and the FOMC minutes; the key question is whether officials validate the market's easing narrative or lean against it.

## 5) China Lunar New Year: Liquidity Distortion Risk
**Continuity: Ongoing (ref: 2026-02-16)**

**What happened:** China's onshore markets are closed for Lunar New Year, and the brief warns thin liquidity can exaggerate offshore CNH and broader Asian moves.

**Why it matters:** When onshore liquidity disappears, price discovery shifts offshore. That can create "false signals" (moves that look meaningful but are mostly liquidity-driven). The real test often comes on re-open, when onshore markets reprice to catch up—or reject—the offshore move.

**What changes the view:** Watch for any outsized CNH moves during the holiday and be prepared for higher volatility next week on reopening.

## Confirmed vs Reported (Readable Version)

### Confirmed (primary / official)
- Japan Q4 GDP at +0.2% annualized came from Japan's Cabinet Office, a major downside surprise versus expectations.
- US markets were closed for Presidents' Day (NYSE/Nasdaq), which reduces liquidity and can distort price signals.

### Reported (secondary / unverified framing)
- Social/video claims of a "massive US armada" moving toward Iran were flagged as likely exaggerated in the brief, with no official DoD confirmation of a new surge.

## What to Watch Next (24–72h)
1. **US–Iran nuclear talks (Geneva):** Any headline that changes sanctions/supply expectations for oil.
2. **Fed communications:** Fed speakers + FOMC minutes; the fastest path to a rates/FX repricing.
3. **BoJ reaction function:** Governor comments and the 10Y JGB yield response after the GDP miss.
4. **European tech follow-through:** Whether AI/tech skepticism broadens into a larger rotation (and spills into US tech).
5. **China holiday liquidity:** CNH behavior during thin conditions; watch for reopen volatility next week.
