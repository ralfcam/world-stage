# Mindmap (canonical nodes & edges)

This file is the canonical conceptual map. Daily briefs propose small deltas; weekly updates consolidate.

## Core node sets
### Pricing engines
- Fed / US rates
- ECB / EUR rates
- BoJ / JPY carry
- China growth/credit impulse
- Oil balance / OPEC+

### Transmission channels
- Rates, FX, Credit, Equities, Volatility
- Inflation, Growth, Liquidity
- Shipping, SupplyChains
- Sanctions, ExportControls, Regulation

### Tail-risk theaters
- Hormuz
- Red Sea/Suez
- Taiwan Strait/South China Sea

## Canonical edges (keep reusing)
- Energy → Inflation → Rates
- Rates → FX → EM stress
- Sanctions → SupplyChains → Growth
- Shipping disruption → Goods inflation → Rates
- Great-power signaling → Volatility → Risk-off

## Node hygiene rules
- Prefer verbs in edge labels ("tightens", "raises", "disrupts").
- Merge nodes if: same mechanism + same indicators + same sources.
- Keep new nodes to ≤3/day and edges to ≤5/day.

## Weekly consolidation checklist
- Identify repeated co-occurrences and elevate them to canonical edges.
- Retire nodes that didn’t reappear for 4+ weeks.
