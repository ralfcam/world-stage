# docs/SOURCES.md — Sources (curation + authority)

Goal: minimize noise and maximize primary confirmation.

## How to curate
For each actor/theme, keep 3–7 primary sources plus 1–2 secondary explainers.

## Primary-source types
- Central banks: statements, minutes, speeches, calendars
- Treasuries/finance ministries: press releases, sanctions, debt statements
- Statistical agencies: CPI/GDP/labor releases
- International orgs: IMF/BIS/OECD for cross-country comparability
- Energy: EIA/IEA/OPEC for balances/forecasts
- Legal: EU Official Journal / national gazettes for binding measures

## Secondary sources (use sparingly)
- High-quality wires/newspapers for speed
- Specialist research for context (not confirmation)

## Source scoring rubric (0–3 each)
- Authority (primary?)
- Timeliness
- Revision/errata behavior
- Signal-to-noise

## Maintenance
- Weekly: drop any source that repeatedly triggers false positives.
- After major events: add a primary source that reduces reliance on rumors.
