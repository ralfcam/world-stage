# Methodology (market-impact bias)

## Objective
Turn the newsflow into a small set of tradable, testable narratives.

## Promotion rule (Top 5)
Promote an item to the daily Top 5 if it plausibly reprices within 1–3 sessions:
- G10 yields (especially US/EA/JP/UK)
- USD broad / major crosses
- Oil/gas (and second-order inflation)
- Global credit spreads
- Major equity indices

Geopolitical items only displace Tier-1 macro drivers when they transmit through:
1) Energy, 2) Shipping/chokepoints, 3) Sanctions/export controls, 4) Great-power escalation.

## Evidence standard
- **Confirmed (primary source):** official release, law/regulation text, central bank statement, sanctions notice, verified data release.
- **Reported (secondary):** media, unnamed officials, analyst notes.

## Mechanism mapping (templates)
Use these canonical chains:
- Energy shock → inflation expectations → rates repricing → FX/risk sentiment
- Sanctions/export controls → supply chains/productivity → growth risk → credit/equities
- Funding stress → USD strength → EM stress → risk-off → commodities/credit
- Escalation risk → risk premium → energy/shipping insurance → inflation

## What to avoid
- Predicting prices precisely.
- Overweighting low-confidence rumors.
- Turning every geopolitical event into a market thesis.

## Weekly review
- Re-score triggers (true/false positives).
- Prune sources that produce noise.
- Merge mindmap nodes that duplicate concepts.
