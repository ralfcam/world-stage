# Linear workflow

Purpose: close the loop between monitoring output and system improvement.

## Issue types
- **Source gap:** missing primary source, or unreliable link.
- **Trigger tuning:** repeated false positives/negatives.
- **Template fix:** sections that produce noise or omit key fields.
- **Coverage change:** promote/demote actors, add a theater.

## Required fields (standard)
- Problem
- Evidence (link + excerpt/summary)
- Proposed fix (file + exact change)
- Success criteria (what will be better next week)

## Weekly cadence
- Monday: triage new issues (close, defer, or schedule).
- Friday: implement 1–3 small improvements.
- Sunday: update weekly mindmap + update changelog.

## Labeling
Use `taxonomy.csv` tags as labels (Rates, FX, Energy, Sanctions, Shipping, etc.).
